<h1>Rest In Peace, Ursula K. LeGuin.</h1>
<p>Thank you, Ursula K. LeGuin, for your wonderful books. You were my favorite author. Your books always made me think, and brought me much joy. It was interesting, but understandable, to read that your basis was in Taoism. No wonder... About so many things I learned from you. Nothing was stale. My favorite quote was from my least favorite of your books, Searoad, which was about a quiet little town on a US coast. It was about the passion of reading. My favorite of your books... Hmm. I loved the Earthsea Trilogy. But the passion of &quot;The Left Hand of Darkness&quot; was engulfing. I will never forget it. Immense gratitude for your contributions to our world, and to my own little universe.</p>
