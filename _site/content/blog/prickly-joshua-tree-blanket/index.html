<h1>Prickly Joshua Tree Blanket</h1>
<p>This is a positive story from Southern California.</p>

<p>Even as developers and politicians in California attempt to thwart efforts to save Joshua Trees, a few people have begun to show that even though they are protected by needing a permit to cut them down, all 200+ permits passed last year. One person started a bill to protect the tree further, after 42,000 acres burnt down last year. You can see the details in the article.</p>
<p>What is heartening to me is that even though things may seem dark for the tree, there are people who are moving forward doing what they can in their own little ways.</p>
<p>It reminds me of the Bible story of David and Goliath. No matter how big the bully may seem, there must be a way to defeat it. Let us put our hearts and our heads together to move forward in whatever ways we personally find passion in. The world needs us. We may be small, but we are not weak.</p>
<p>Also, strength is not just literal fighting. It is following your joys, what makes you feel happy, while doing something for the world.</p>
<p>Of course, we need to be smart about it. My father told me I couldn't study Art in university because I wouldn't be able to make a living off of it as an adult. It was practical advice, and so I chose Biology, and that has been a really good decision I think, throughout my life. I studied two extra years for things that interested me, and was able to study Sumi-E in Japan. I think this helped me in the long run; my grades and my self-esteem were raised by doing things that I was good at while studying difficult subjects... I guess what I want to say is that just because we want to do something, doesn't necessarily mean it is the best thing.</p>
<p>I think we should think carefully about the consequences of not acting right now in certain respects. I hope that my posts make a difference. Getting a Ph.D. was important, but I don't know that anyone will ever read my dissertation. It's a shame, because five years went into it, but the most important thing for me was the wisdom I got out of doing it. As I write posts that are related to my research, I think they reach many more people than my studies ever will, unless I get famous. But during those five years of studies, I did a lot that I felt was good. I saved a lot of little animals, I was a volunteer at Kizuna Baby (an orphaned baby massage organization), I helped fellow students, organized community music events, and other social events for students...</p>
<p>But right now, for me, writing blog posts is one of the most powerful things I can do right now, I think. I also think that making videos about edibles and medicinals would be fun and well-appreciated.</p>
<p>What can you do for the world, something that you think you are good at and love to do? I'm sure you are full of treasures. 🌟[Previous Rainforest Burning Investors](file:///Users/sofiap/Documents/Publii/sites/sofiapenabazcom/preview/rainforest-burning-investors.html)</p>
