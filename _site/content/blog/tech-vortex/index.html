<h1>Tech vortex?</h1>

<p>So I was reading this article about how Chinese LCD panel companies are winning the race against LG and Samsung. The article is posted here.</p>

<p>It seems like there's a tech vortex movement going on; they're just trying to focus on the same technology instead of looking outside the box. They're trying to make old technology better and better, and branch out into new kinds of panels. That being said, they're still panels.</p>
<p>We could be being had; I often feel like they come up with technology and don't actually put it out because they want to make money for the next year or two on old tech, but with this, I don't think that's the case.</p>
<p>I feel like with AR and that kind of technology, there's a lot of potential that hasn't been tapped that relates really closely. I predict that there's going to be a huge shift within the next five years away from solid panels.</p>
<p>I think they probably have people working in think tanks in some of these companies trying to figure out new technology and how to integrate it into AR technology, or maybe I'm wrong. Maybe it's just Google. The thing is that LCD panels (TV's, monitors) take up a lot of natural resources, not to mention space in your house, and I'm sure that there is a better way to convey information.</p>
<p>I know there are a lot of people now using projectors, like the really cool projectors from Xiaomi that can be really close to the wall and are silent and can give you a really nice, big picture, but still projectors have their limitations like light interference.</p>
<p>So I'm thinking, something like some special glasses where you can look into them and see the AR of your favorite TV show or surf the net without having to take up any space at all... Kind of reminds me of a guy from the 1920s with a monocle.[Previous Today's Gifts - Paul &amp; the Wixarika](file:///Users/sofiap/Documents/Publii/sites/sofiapenabazcom/preview/todays-gifts-paul-andamp-the-wixarika.html)</p>
