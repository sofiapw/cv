<h1>No-Bake Awesome Cookies!</h1>
<p>Hi guys! I have a suuuuper E-Z, tummy yummy recipe for you today! It is no-bake vegetarian cocoa cookies… Mmm'M!<br>
I got a pack of 'Green Banana Flour' on iHerb. There was really no other flour to choose from, but this was pretty cheap and is really healthy, so I'm glad I got it! It doesn't need to be cooked, either.</p>

<p>It has a similar recipe to what I made on the back, but I like to substitute oils and sugars for things that are less heavy. It calls for 3TBSP of coconut oil… Very greasy. Sometimes we can substitute milks for oils, and in this case it works. I substituted that for 1 TBSP of soymilk.</p>

<p>Instead of rolling the cookies in coconut flakes, I rolled them in Almond Flour, very easy to find in Japan.</p>
<p>And instead of 3 TBSP of hard-to-find Agave Nectar, I added 1 TBSP of Honey plus a tsp of Stevia, so the calorie content is really low but it doesn't have that stevia taste.</p>
<p>Here is my recipe. The ingredients don't have to be precise:</p>
<p>3 TBSP Green Banana Flour (or coconut flour)<br>
3 TBSP Cocoa Powder (unsweetened)<br>
3 TBSP Any Nut Butter<br>
1 TBSP Soymilk or Milk<br>
1 TBSP Honey or a thick Syrup<br>
1 tsp Stevia<br>
Some Almond Flour spread out in a plate<br>
A few Almonds</p>
<p>Mix together everything except the almond flour and the almonds until they stick together, about three minutes.<br>
Wash your hands. Take about a TBSP and roll it in your hands. Squeeze an almond into the top and fit it around it. Roll the cookie in the almond flour. Remove the excess.</p>
<p>Put it on a plate and do the next one. Put them in the fridge for a few hours until they have set. Enjoy!</p>
<p>These are amazing cookies!! They are really filling and sweet but creamy, and they don't have that much fat in them. They have a lot of fiber and protein. And best of all, they taste incredible!![Previous The real Lord of the Flies: what happened when six boys were shipwrecked for 15 months | Books | The Guardian](file:///Users/sofiap/Documents/Publii/sites/sofiapenabazcom/preview/the-real-lord-of-the-flies-what-happened-when-six-boys-were-shipwrecked-for-15-months-or-books-or-the-guardian.html)</p>
