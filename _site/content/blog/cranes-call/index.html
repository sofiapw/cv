<h1>Crane's Call</h1>
<p>I learned a new Japanese idiom today. It is 鶴の一声. It means &quot;the decision that has been made by the highest ranking official or person.&quot; It sounds so stiff in English. The literal translation is, &quot;the single call of a crane.&quot;</p>
<p>So I decided to write a poem, a haiku.</p>
<p>美白氷河の鏡 鶴の一声 私らの血を呼ぶ。</p>
<p>The whitening glacial mirror</p>
<p>Crane's solitary voice</p>
<p>Calls our blood.</p>

<p>People often don't get my poems... They are too symbolic. I end up having to explain them... Can anyone guess the meaning?[Previous Prickly Joshua Tree Blanket](file:///Users/sofiap/Documents/Publii/sites/sofiapenabazcom/preview/prickly-joshua-tree-blanket.html)</p>
