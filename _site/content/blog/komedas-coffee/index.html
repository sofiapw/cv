<h1>Komeda's Coffee</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Today we went to coffee at Komeda's. I thought we would go to the one by the station, with the shadows, dark wood and mirrors in Golden light, but we drove the other way, and then we were there. It seemed like it used to be another chain restaurant, with the layout. But the place was a pleasant wooden frame building, and we got a table in a corner, where I was able to keep writing my paper on the P40 Yoga, which I have never regreted buying. It is an incredibly useful machine. I got the rest of a table worked out, and the accompanying writing. I also studied how to use Medibang, a drawing program, drawing a building with some landscaping with the pen and touch functions. It was a peaceful and productive afternoon. I no longer feel so bummed about not being able to spend Thanksgiving with family and close friends.</p>
