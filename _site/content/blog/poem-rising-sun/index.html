<h1>Poem - Rising Sun</h1>
<p>I love how the rising Sun</p>
<p>Shoots its intensions across the sky</p>
<p>caressing the resigned but expectant Mountains,</p>
<p>bathing them in wider and wider</p>
<p>Maxwell Parrish pastels of</p>
<p>purple and pink and orange,</p>
<p>where there was only eternal dark gray a breath, a moment, before.</p>

<p>Poem &quot;Rising Sun&quot; by Sofia Penabaz-Wiley, on January 5th, 2023, upon opening the gate for the albañiles and rising to the 3rd floor to find the splendor of day had begun considering it's ascent into The Times.</p>
<p>The simple version was:</p>
<p>I love how the rising Sun caresses the expectant Mountains,<br>
bathing them and pastels of purple and pink and orange,<br>
where there was only gray a moment before.</p>
<p>And I wanted to say something about the little doves, greeting that union in graceful explosions of wings and voice, but I dared not invade that peaceful space between the Mountains and the Sun, it stayed a bit quieter in verse.</p>
