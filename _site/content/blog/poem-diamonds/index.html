<h1>Poem - Diamonds</h1>
<p><img src="/media/posts/21/dropletsoflife.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I was looking at the droplets of water on the plants I just watered, and thought that it would be entirely logical if our love of gems came from the excitement upon it raining or finding water in prehistoric times, and even up to 200 years ago. Water must have been so treasured, and jewels look so much like little droplets of water...</p>
<p>We found water! Rush back to the cave.<br>
Diamonds in sunlight<br>
Excitement, life in a moment<br>
Rain, rainbow gems<br>
Dew, quiet jewels hanging, glittering pink<br>
before the last star dissappears<br>
A drink, life to berries, life to creatures, life to all</p>
<p>Gazing out at stars below<br>
glance at my ring finger<br>
new engagement<br>
hope, not water<br>
rain solidified<br>
into a shining diamond.</p>
