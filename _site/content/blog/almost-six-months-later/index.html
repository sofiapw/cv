<h1>Almost Six Months Later</h1>
<p>I, uh, went to the karaoke box by myself today.</p>
<p>I used to sing a lot until Shinpei got sick a few years ago, and something started to wither within me... but I still sang and refused to completely give up until he actually passed away. Then I was lost. Throughout my entire life, it had been how I healed myself when I was depressed. But I have been having a hard time singing since he passed on.</p>
<p>I found going to karaoke to be very cathartic. At home I had tried and it hadn't worked out. I felt trapped. Every time I would try to sing alone, I would cry... and it has been months like this. But towards the end of my karaoke session, I felt much better. I felt like I was able to hit notes I hadn't hit in a long time, and the strength in my voice and my vibrato came more freely.</p>
<p>In general, recently, despite the situation, I'm feeling really thankful for my life and this chance that I have on Earth to make ripples of joy or peace in people's lives. I pray for the necessary vitality to take me forward and out of this sad shade I have been under since he disappeared, and before that. I am thankful all the time for the moments we were together and for all he taught me. It was really very hard, but I loved him immensely and I don't regret my time with him. It's amazing how old I feel now, and how many eye wrinkles have appeared, after six months of this.</p>
<p>But each day is a little brighter, and I realize that I am still alive bit by bit, even though there is an emptiness where he once was. Part of going into the light is the struggle.</p>
<p>Life is a struggle, but the struggle brings treasure. I hope to be able to share what I find. I wanted to upload Moon River, which I sang today... It is a horrible recording, and it's my first time actually really putting some effort into singing in a very long time. I used to practice every day. May this wonderful, light-filled, guiding Universe be my Moon River to share this World and all of its inhabitants with me.</p>
