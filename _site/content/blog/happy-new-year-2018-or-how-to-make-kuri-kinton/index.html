<h1>Happy New Year, 2018 OR How to Make Kuri Kinton</h1>
<p>I have fond memories of gardenias growing up. My mother loved them, and she would pick them when she could and put them in a little vase in the house. The whole living room would fill with that wonderful scent.</p>
<p>In Japan, the non-horticultural variety can commonly be found in traditional house gardens. It is called &quot;Kuchinashi&quot; or &quot;No mouth&quot;, and can be found in the US as perhaps the Kleim's Hardy Gardenia -- the flower looks quite similar. The flowers have five petals, and smell just as delicious. Instead of the many more petals, energy goes to making a lively-colored orange fruit in the late fall. Inside, a mass of red seeds and mush can be found. If you touch it when it's fresh, your fingers will get dyed yellow.</p>
<p>This is a powerful yellow dye, traditionally used in all sorts of foods, and in not so traditional foods as well; it can be found commonly just like yellow #5 on normal supermarket foods and beverages.</p>
<p>This bright dye is used during times of festivity, including New Year's. It is used in a dish that I decided to make today called Kuri Kinton.</p>
<p>Ingredients:</p>
<p>2 Gardenia fruits</p>
<p>Yam or Sweet Potatoes: 500 grams</p>
<p>Sweet chestnuts, cooked: 12</p>
<p>Sugar: 1/2 cup</p>
<p>Mirin: 5 Tbsp</p>
<p>Honey: 2 Tbsp</p>
<p>Salt: 1/2 tsp</p>
<p>Need:</p>
<p>-A teabag or something to put the Gardenia fruit into, a pot, a yam smashing utensil.</p>
<p>Directions:</p>
<p>Peel and slice the yams and put to soak into cool water. Slice the Gardenia fruits up one side and put inside a teabag. Crush.</p>
<p>Get the other ingredients ready.</p>
<p>Drain the yams. Rinse. Add enough water to them in the pot to barely cover them. Place the teabag in, stir. Bring to a gentle boil and cook until soft. They should be a bright golden yellow.</p>
<p>Drain. Add half the sugar and smash until smooth while hot.</p>
<p>Add the rest of the ingredients and cook on low heat while stirring until the alcohol evaporates (about 4 - 5 minutes).</p>
<p>Smooth it into a bowl or container and enjoy.</p>
<p>... I think adding some vanilla, a little cinnamon, and some pralines or roasted pecans on top would be delicious!</p>
