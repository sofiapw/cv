<h1>Leading the CoVID-19 World</h1>

<p>What an amazing, surprising world we live in. If only we always held such fresh viewpoints, like those in <a href="https://www.bangkokpost.com/world/1887745/dogs-being-trained-to-sniff-out-covid-19">this article</a>, we would not be in the environmental and strained political situations we tend to be in.</p>
<p>For us to find endless sustainability, I believe it behooves us to adopt a system that is changeable depending on necessity. Linear only in bite-size chunks. True Test-Driven Development.</p>
<p>We, as the leaders of our world, are doing a horrible job. It is time to reflect our realities in Wabi-sabi rather than the Western ideal of taking all at once. And CoVID-19 is giving us that opportunity.</p>
<p>Opportunity to breathe, take chances in ways we would never have, and begin afresh. Let's do this and keep a curious puppy viewpoint!</p>
