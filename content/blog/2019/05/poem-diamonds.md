# Poem - Diamonds

![](/media/posts/21/dropletsoflife.jpg)

I was looking at the droplets of water on the plants I just watered, and thought that it would be entirely logical if our love of gems came from the excitement upon it raining or finding water in prehistoric times, and even up to 200 years ago. Water must have been so treasured, and jewels look so much like little droplets of water...

We found water! Rush back to the cave.  
Diamonds in sunlight  
Excitement, life in a moment  
Rain, rainbow gems  
Dew, quiet jewels hanging, glittering pink  
before the last star dissappears  
A drink, life to berries, life to creatures, life to all

Gazing out at stars below  
glance at my ring finger  
new engagement  
hope, not water  
rain solidified  
into a shining diamond.
