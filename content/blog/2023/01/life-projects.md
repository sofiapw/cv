# Life Projects

I was thinking a new thought.  
Before, I believed that there were things that could be done by someone else if I don't do them.

Now I see, years later, that there are many things that only I can do.  
Not only that, the state of the universe in that moment is special to fit whatever it is I have conceived of. So if I don't do it, quite possibly it could disappear into the fabrics of time and space, never to come to be.  
I was thinking this about research into bird behavior and language, which I wanted to research as a child, but didn't know I could and neither did anyone else. I wanted to be a bird watcher. Over the years, I have considered it again over and over, but it always seems like something less important than what I could do.

But I see also, now, that if I don't do it, it will probably never be done, at least not the way I would have. Or what I would have studied.  
My genius Grandpa once told me (after having live half a life of debauchery), "La vida no es un juego ni una diversión." He was nearing his end, and he still wanted to do so much. I feel that way, too, though perhaps not quite as intensely since I'm still pretty young... Life goes by... It's never long enough. We should do what we can while we can, before it's too late.

So if you have a dream that you want to come to life, chase it. Don't let it slip into oblivion. Give it life, breathe your soul into it.
