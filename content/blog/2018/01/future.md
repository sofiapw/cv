# Future

Monty said, "The answer is remarkably simple but complex in execution. Do what will provide you the most freedom of time and spirit."

My response, each one considering another need: living with people who are close to me, writing lots of papers, getting a permanent position, maintaining ties with family and friends or even buying investment property near them, saving up... and staying out of economically or emotionally draining relationships.

Another friend, very cleverly I might say, told me the worst-case scenario of what she thought I might do over the next few months, and how it would affect me 10 years from now.

I refuse to prove her right. I have to be strong.
