# Almost Six Months Later

I, uh, went to the karaoke box by myself today.

I used to sing a lot until Shinpei got sick a few years ago, and something started to wither within me... but I still sang and refused to completely give up until he actually passed away. Then I was lost. Throughout my entire life, it had been how I healed myself when I was depressed. But I have been having a hard time singing since he passed on.

I found going to karaoke to be very cathartic. At home I had tried and it hadn't worked out. I felt trapped. Every time I would try to sing alone, I would cry... and it has been months like this. But towards the end of my karaoke session, I felt much better. I felt like I was able to hit notes I hadn't hit in a long time, and the strength in my voice and my vibrato came more freely.

In general, recently, despite the situation, I'm feeling really thankful for my life and this chance that I have on Earth to make ripples of joy or peace in people's lives. I pray for the necessary vitality to take me forward and out of this sad shade I have been under since he disappeared, and before that. I am thankful all the time for the moments we were together and for all he taught me. It was really very hard, but I loved him immensely and I don't regret my time with him. It's amazing how old I feel now, and how many eye wrinkles have appeared, after six months of this.

But each day is a little brighter, and I realize that I am still alive bit by bit, even though there is an emptiness where he once was. Part of going into the light is the struggle.

Life is a struggle, but the struggle brings treasure. I hope to be able to share what I find. I wanted to upload Moon River, which I sang today... It is a horrible recording, and it's my first time actually really putting some effort into singing in a very long time. I used to practice every day. May this wonderful, light-filled, guiding Universe be my Moon River to share this World and all of its inhabitants with me.
