# Rainforest Burning Investors

Here is a report by Amazon Watch of beneficiaries to the burning of the Amazon Jungle. Yes, folks, it's happening again.

As a CNN article stated yesterday, Bolsonaro called it lies, but "evidence shows differently." There is illegal logging and slavery happening. China is the biggest buyer of products from the Amazon... but who buys the end products? The report gives advice for governments on how to deal with the issue, and long lists of companies that are investing in the carnage. Some of ways we can combat it:

1\. To write to the companies with which we are investing and express our dismay at their irresponsibility... and if at all possible boycott them if they don't respond.  
2\. To reuse and recycle, not buy new furniture.  
3\. To invest with green investors and companies that are trying to go green.  
4\. To donate to NGOs like this one, so that we can get more quality information and someone is out there working to stop what is happening.

The Amazon Rainforest provides us with many things that we need --- Alive. Not in our kitchens or living rooms.
