# Crane's Call

I learned a new Japanese idiom today. It is 鶴の一声. It means "the decision that has been made by the highest ranking official or person." It sounds so stiff in English. The literal translation is, "the single call of a crane."

So I decided to write a poem, a haiku.

美白氷河の鏡 鶴の一声 私らの血を呼ぶ。

The whitening glacial mirror

Crane's solitary voice

Calls our blood.

People often don't get my poems... They are too symbolic. I end up having to explain them... Can anyone guess the meaning?
