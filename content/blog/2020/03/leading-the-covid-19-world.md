# Leading the CoVID-19 World

![](/media/posts/25/IMG_20200313_120207-scaled.jpg)

What an amazing, surprising world we live in. If only we always held such fresh viewpoints, like those in [this article](https://www.bangkokpost.com/world/1887745/dogs-being-trained-to-sniff-out-covid-19), we would not be in the environmental and strained political situations we tend to be in.

For us to find endless sustainability, I believe it behooves us to adopt a system that is changeable depending on necessity. Linear only in bite-size chunks. True Test-Driven Development.

We, as the leaders of our world, are doing a horrible job. It is time to reflect our realities in Wabi-sabi rather than the Western ideal of taking all at once. And CoVID-19 is giving us that opportunity.

Opportunity to breathe, take chances in ways we would never have, and begin afresh. Let's do this and keep a curious puppy viewpoint!
