# Atomoxetine, oxidative stress and mitochondrial function in humans

<https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-49609-9>

Takeaway: For children and adults taking Atomoxetine, supplement it with vitamins C & E, and other antioxidant sources like fresh fruit and vegetables. This will most likely prevent DNA changes and preserve healthy mitochondrial activity in the brain cells. If they are not taken, it seems that some serious cellular changes occur over time.

A large percentage of people take these kinds of medications, even though we have little knowledge about their effects.

...Actually, this is my own assessment from reading other articles about psychiatric drugs, but we don't know enough about their effects on the brain/body system. It is clear that they often cause weight gain, over which mitochondrial activity is one factor. Also, I have read that they can cause permanent changes in DNA. So actually, if you or anyone you love is taking these medications, it is probably a good idea to supplement them with antioxidants no matter what drug it may be.
