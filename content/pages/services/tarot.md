# Tarot Reading by Sofia

![](/media/posts/115/20171001_194937-300x225.jpg)

Are you looking for guidance? Do you have a specific question?

I can help you to organize your thoughts and give you some direction. My clients have say they feel "more relaxed," "glad," and "more peaceful."

Let's try it together!

**How It Works:**

  1. To get a session, please email me at the bottom of this page with 3 seperate possible dates and times (If outside Japan, please include your location or time zone).
  2. I will contact you with one of the times that works for me, and send you the address to my online room at Zoom or Duo. We will meet there at the selected time.

Note:

Cost: Tarot Reading (English, Spanish, or Japanese): $20 USD / 30 minutes (most last 20-30 minutes). $10 for every ten minutes after that. The session starts when I begin shuffling the cards, so we will have time to chat beforehand.

Studying English? Cost for Japanese/English or Spanish/English Sessions 'Learning English through Tarot' available at the same base rate. You choose how long you want your session to be.

When you finish the session, please feel free to email me feedback on your experience! Thank you so much!
