# Welcome!

![](/media/posts/114/20171125_160323-300x225.jpg)

Hi there! Thanks for visiting my site. I hope that you enjoy the trip!

Please enjoy my personal website. I enjoy my research in Ethnobotany, ecosystems and society. I like reading Tarot and do this as a part-time job. I savor the times I can spend with language students, because I love teaching.

On this website, you will find my blog, a way to reach me for a reading and perhaps some other fun stuff.
