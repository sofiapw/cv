**Frequently Asked Questions**

 _Please read our FAQ before sending us a message_.

"What are the payment methods for orders from the Online Shop?"

We accept PayPal and direct bank transfer to US or Japanese banks.

"How long will delivery take?"

Depending on the length, the level English, and the logical coherence of the academic paper, editing times vary. On average, a 5-page paper (not including the reference section), requires three days, plus or minus two days. Usually it takes less than more time.  

"How secure is shopping in the Online Shop? Is my data protected?"

Your data is protected, as is your research. This establishment has history with Chiba University's Department of Horticulture, as the editor is a lecturer and alumnus there. Therefore, we treasure all research, maintaining professionalism and employing up-to-date security software on our machines.

  

"What exactly happens after ordering?"

We will provide a quote for the amount according to the number of words and begin work immediately. Upon completion, an invoice is sent along with a certificate of editing. The paper is submitted simultaneously, and will contain edits, comments regarding grammar and syntax, and comments regarding logical coherence issues if needed. To increase the likelihood of publication, it is my policy to try to act as a reviewer might. This is unusual in my competition, as most companies mainly do English editing.

"Do I receive an invoice for my order?"

Yes, you will receive a quote at the beginning to submit to the university office, and an invoice and certificate of English editing upon completion of the job.
