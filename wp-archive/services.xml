		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>Today we went to coffee at Komeda's. I thought we would go to the one by the station, with the shadows, dark wood and mirrors in Golden light, but we drove the other way, and then we were there. It seemed like it used to be another chain restaurant, with the layout. But the place was a pleasant wooden frame building, and we got a table in a corner, where I was able to keep writing my paper on the P40 Yoga, which I have never regreted buying. It is an incredibly useful machine. I got the rest of a table worked out, and the accompanying writing. I also studied how to use Medibang, a drawing program, drawing a building with some landscaping with the pen and touch functions. It was a peaceful and productive afternoon. I no longer feel so bummed about not being able to spend Thanksgiving with family and close friends.</blockquote>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I have fond memories of gardenias growing up. My mother loved them, and she would pick them when she could and put them in a little vase in the house. The whole living room would fill with that wonderful scent.

In Japan, the non-horticultural variety  can commonly be found in traditional house gardens. It is called "Kuchinashi" or "No mouth", and can be found in the US as perhaps the Kleim's Hardy Gardenia -- the flower looks quite similar. The flowers have five petals, and smell just as delicious. Instead of the many more petals, energy goes to making a lively-colored orange fruit in the late fall. Inside, a mass of red seeds and mush can be found. If you touch it when it's fresh, your fingers will get dyed yellow.

This is a powerful yellow dye, traditionally used in all sorts of foods, and in not so traditional foods as well; it can be found commonly just like yellow #5 on normal supermarket foods and beverages.

This bright dye is used during times of festivity, including New Year's. It is used in a dish that I decided to make today called Kuri Kinton.

Ingredients:

2 Gardenia fruits

Yam or Sweet Potatoes: 500 grams

Sweet chestnuts, cooked: 12

Sugar: 1/2 cup

Mirin:  5 Tbsp

Honey: 2 Tbsp

Salt: 1/2 tsp

Need:

-A teabag or something to put the Gardenia fruit into, a pot, a yam smashing utensil.

Directions:

Peel and slice the yams and put to soak into cool water. Slice the Gardenia fruits up one side and put inside a teabag. Crush.

Get the other ingredients ready.

Drain the yams. Rinse. Add enough water to them in the pot to barely cover them. Place the teabag in, stir. Bring to a gentle boil and cook until soft. They should be a bright golden yellow.

Drain. Add half the sugar and smash until smooth while hot.

Add the rest of the ingredients and cook on low heat while stirring until the alcohol evaporates (about 4 - 5 minutes).

Smooth it into a bowl or container and enjoy.

... I think adding some vanilla, a little cinnamon, and some pralines or roasted pecans on top would be delicious!

My response, each one considering another need: living with people who are close to me, writing lots of papers, getting a permanent position, maintaining ties with family and friends or even buying investment property near them, saving up... and staying out of economically or emotionally draining relationships.

Another friend, very cleverly I might say, told me the worst-case scenario of what she thought I might do over the next few months, and how it would affect me 10 years from now.

I refuse to prove her right. I have to be strong.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So, I have a theory, a religion you could call it, that everything is connected, like a fractal in time and space, and that the fractal is God. But then, I had to figure out where love came in, and for many years, I couldn't imagine what love would be. But I knew it was important, because in every major religion it is central to the ideas and ideals.And then it hit me tonight, over the head, like a giant spoonful of partially solidified pudding.Love is the connection. It is what connects the fractal together, it is the glue that pulls things together and propels them forward into space-time. It is what makes babies. It is love at first sight. It is true understanding. It is feeling truly alive. It is surging forward in a race to the finish, and the hugs that ensue. It is smelling a rose and knowing it is rose. It is breathing a first breath.Then there are other things. Like hatred. I would have to think that that is love on a strange vibration that has been ruined momentarily.How about indifference you might ask? Well, indifference is the middle, the place where love is ebbing away.For remember, it is all a fractal. And what is a fractal of the universe but a giant and all-encompassing sine wave?<img class="size-full" data-wpid="59" src="https://www.sofiapenabaz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/img_20200516_012408539632890659640558-scaled.jpg" />]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/signs-japan-demographic-time-bomb-2017-3">The elderly have a use in our society. They teach us about the past. They help us make decisions because they have lived a long time and may know more than we do. The tenth one in this article is so sad.</a> People should not have to die alone. A lot of the problems with these is that the elderly are lonely. Another that I see as a long-term resident in Japan, is that the empty houses left behind are a precious asset being laid to waste.

However, in Japan, there are problems preventing some of the issues stemming from this aging society from being solved. The legal system needs to be revamped. And people need to start trusting strangers, since they have no reliable family.

There are some solutions I have thought about regarding the issue of empty buildings. There are at least seven in my neighborhood alone.  However, new apartment buildings and townhouses are being built all the time. The empty houses remain empty, and oftentimes are demolished, destroying precious historical and traditional assets. One reason that they don't rent, is that people don't trust others to manage their property. The law supports renters, so it makes it difficult to evict them. However, years can go by after someone dies before anything is done with the property, due to legal battles. Squatting is unheard of and out of the question, apparently. To resolve this issue, I think that people needing housing should be able to temporarily live in empty houses, and give the owners a priority for kicking them out if need be. It would have to be a special condition that the house was empty after someone had died. I think that this would solve a lot of housing issues in the cities surrounding Tokyo. That being said, there is an <a href="http://akiyakanri.org/">organization that supports managing empty houses</a>, but in this case, the owners of the house are the ones that come forward as the managers, meaning that the ownership must be established first, which can take years. Meanwhile the house is rusting and rotting.

As for the elderly being alone and lonely, there is an organization that supports undergraduate students living with elderly but still active and healthy people, and sets up a contract between them. The organization is called <a href="http://liveandlive.org/about.html">「<em>NPO</em>法人リブ＆リブ」 or "NPO Live &amp; Live"</a>.  Their introduction says: "ＮＰＯ法人リブ＆リブが行っている「世代間交流ホームシェア事業」は、 日常的にあまり接点のない、シニアと大学生の同居によって、 新しく生まれる「血縁をこえた絆を作る」ことを目的としています。 かつての「下宿」とは違い、シニアと大学生が同等の立場で支え合い、毎日を楽しみに生きていける新しい社会への一歩になる事業です。"

Some of the issues I can easily see are that if young people live alone, they have a lot more freedom. They can have guests over to spend the night. They don't have to come home each night. The rules seem a little strict to me in favor of the elderly. Also, the rent is only 20,000 yen, the cost of utilities every month. Even so, a person can rent a place in the outskirts of Tokyo for a little over this cost. Another issue I can see is that it is only for undergraduate students. What about graduate students? What about when the student graduates but still wants to live there? Other rules are that students must eat dinner with the elderly person at least 3 times per week to establish friendship, and a curfew of 11 is set.

Despite these advantages to the house owner, the NPO is having a hard time finding elderly people interested in doing this! There is a waiting list for students at the time of this post, January 2017. I'm not sure what the problem is. Maybe they haven't been advertising? Maybe the advertisement is not appealing enough? I'm not sure, but it seems amazing to me. I can only assume a number of things. Maybe elderly people in Japan have high pride inhibiting them from renting out a room? Perhaps they feel badly that they have to do this since their children won't live with them?  Maybe, and I think this is the most likely, they think that the students might hurt them or cause trouble?

Either way, I think that if elderly people were not so isolated, they would be able to live in peace up to the time they couldn't take care of themselves anymore, and if there were a way to deal with the housing instead of making new ones, we could help our world and save precious historical assets.]]></content:encoded>

I found the cutest tiny cow in the bathroom!! Just kidding! He was a bat, but from the front, he looks just like a little cow to me!!

Bina, my kitty, had been acting funny all evening, looking at the ceiling and pacing, but I couldn't find anything unusual. Then, as I was getting ready for bed, I went into the bathroom and she jumped on the toilet to try to get to something at the top corner of the window... It was a little bat! I grabbed her, and as I did, it swooped down on us, and then fell on the floor, apparently in deep shock. I put Bina in a room, got a towel, and picked him up ever so gently. He was so light, his little body giving off heat, and breathing heavily. I put him outside in the plants, lightly wrapped for warmth, and went to see what to do about a bat in winter. I found that bats hybernate in the winter. But he had come awake, so I was worried. I tried to make a makeshift bat house for him on the fly, but by the time I got back outside, he had flown off. I hope he's okay. He was a dear little thing.

Now I have to go out and get some materials to make a bat house. After all the videos and websites I found last night, I realized that they aren't hard to make, and I already provide water for the birds, so they would have water to drink. With that, and a safe place to put it, where it will get plenty of sun (because they need warmth), the bats will have a nice place to live (not our walls -- so that was what we were hearing a month ago all through the house!) and will keep the mosquitoes away in the summer.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Thank you, Ursula K. LeGuin, for your wonderful books. You were my favorite author. Your books always made me think, and brought me much joy. It was interesting, but understandable, to read that your basis was in Taoism. No wonder... About so many things I learned from you. Nothing was stale. My favorite quote was from my least favorite of your books, Searoad, which was about a quiet little town on a US coast. It was about the passion of reading. My favorite of your books... Hmm. I loved the Earthsea Trilogy. But the passion of "The Left Hand of Darkness" was engulfing. I will never forget it. Immense gratitude for your contributions to our world, and to my own little universe.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Want to have an interesting evening figuring out how different cultures view gender through pop media? This can be done by accessing Netflix around the world.

I noticed this <a href="https://www.google.co.jp/amp/amp.slate.com/articles/life/the_kids/2017/11/how_to_stop_sexism_and_raise_a_son_who_respects_women.html">issue of sexism</a> really deeply when I had the chance to choose different countries' Netflix. Netflix selects it's shows based on what they think will be popular (obviously).

People watch shows that identify with their social norms. While Japanese Netflix didn't show extreme sexism, Sweden's Netflix floored me.

It contained a lot of shows about women in positions of power, non-prettied up women, lesbianism, and other positions of decision-making and power, leading me to think that Swedish people consider women to be a strong and important part of society, able to make decisions about the world around them and what they want for themselves.

The US Netflix was extremely sexist. There was a clear distinction between girl's shows and boy's shows. Women, even if in positions of power, have to fit a physical feminine standard (great example: Wonder Woman). There is not much gender identity swapping, and there are a lot of labels for what is good or bad. Rather than lesbianism, there is a lot of 'what women can sexually do for men', like the movies about the nympho, and sexy girl horror flicks. But it is also clear that Americans are struggling with an internal discussion about gender identity and what it means.

As I see it, In the end, as long as women feel that they need to be physically attractive for men, they will be on a lower power rung.

Women should get pretty for themselves, not so that they can fling themselves at men in high places. They should be able to believe that they can do as well as men can, regardless of their physical state. After all, we are not hunting with clubs and spears or living in caves anymore. It's time for a societal evolution.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I had kind of nightmare trying to do this, so I am writing this for my fellow Expats living in Japan. The US government addresses are unclear, and this caused problems.

To renew your passport, if you have lived in Japan for about 10 years and have a Japan Post Bank card, you can use your card to make the payment for the money order (currently $110) payable to the US government.

To get the money order
You will need:
<ul>
	<li>Your MyNumber card (a Japanese Tax card)</li>
	<li>Your Japan Post Bank Card or Bank Book</li>
	<li>Your Inkan (If for some reason you do not have the password number for your bank account)</li>
</ul>
Directions:
<ol>
	<li>Bring in the items above.</li>
	<li>Ask for an in-country "kokusai yubin kawase"</li>
	<li>Address the money order to: "U.S. Department of State"</li>
	<li>In the address area write: "PSC 471 Box 1111 FPO, AP"</li>
	<li>The Country is: "USA"</li>
	<li>The postal code is: "96347"</li>
</ol>
Then prepare your envelope for sending everything in.

Address the envelope to The American Embassy in Tokyo if you live in the Tokyo Metropolitan Area (includes Chiba, Saitama and some other prefectures). If not, please check the internet for where to send it, most likely your local consulate.

In my case, this was what I wrote on the envelope I sent:

米国大使館　領事部　旅券課

〒107-8420

American Embassy, Passport Division

1-10-5 Akasaka, Minato-ku, Tokyo 〒107-8420

<img src="http://www.sofiapenabaz.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/20180327_155619282299235.jpg" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-75" width="3024" height="4032">

When you are done, it should contain:

1. - Your US passport.

2. - 50mm X 50mm (2x2 inch) photo with a white background (not blue). You can take them at the photo booths outside large stores for ¥700-¥800. Be sure you powder your face. Those things take horrible photos.

Cut out the photo and staple it to your DS-82 form according to the directions.

3. - Your printed out, completed, signed and dated DS-82 form.

4. - The money order fee of $110.

<img src="http://www.sofiapenabaz.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/20180327_1548281941701127.jpg" class="alignnone wp-image-76 size-full" width="3024" height="4032" data-temp-aztec-id="0f523d81-1abe-4468-9194-0031dfeecbb6">

5. - A self-addressed, insured envelope. I chose the one that that they need a signature for, because I didn't want my new passport sitting in the mailbox outside.(~¥500)

(6.) The envelope itself - An addressed envelope to the Embassy to send all these things in (~¥300).

You should give them 4-6 weeks to process and deliver your new passport. Good luck!!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I saw this problem when I visited the Huichol Indians 20 years ago. Agribusiness firms had come, provided chemicals that destroyed the ecosystem in the soil, and created economic debt in a community that could not afford to pay it back. Further, this debt extends into another, ecological debt, that affects not only their land, but our world as a whole. As a researcher in Horticulture, I firmly beloeve that it is high time that academia involved in agriculture studied how ECOSYSTEMS work, and focus on them, not on chemicals and biological mutations that destroy them. There is plenty to study there, but it is uncharted territory. To change the paradigms of science requires innovation, creativity, and dedication. Belief in new methods and ideas is necessary, but it can be, and is slowly being done. Let us join this revolution and create a better world through interdisciplinary research that challenges big money and destructive practices. Everyone, not only researchers, but everyone has the ability to change their immediate surroundings. May we be blessed with the inspiration to love our world and make it a better one.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So I have a balcony garden, and I haven't given it as much time as a proper gardener might, which is not necessarily a bad thing if you like to eat spring weeds... since what I would be weeding are the edible greens! Who needs to grow veg when it pops right up?

<img class="alignnone wp-image-79 size-full" src="http://www.sofiapenabaz.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/20180405_1023031104679930.jpg" width="3024" height="4032">

Also, spring shoots on trees can be edible. Here in Japan, the shoots of many plants can be eaten after parboiling. In the spring, when vegetables are scarce and expensive, it is a good time to prune your edible fruit trees and get your greens in that way!

Today I picked chickweed (too late and bitter raw because it now has flowers), dandelion and it's cousin, and I trimmed some spring shoots off my adorable little mulberries so that they will bush out.

I washed the greens, and ate the dandelion right away because it was so tender and irresistible.

The other ones I gently placed in boiling water, and cooked for about three seconds. Then I took them out and put them in a bowl of cold water. Finally they got swished around a few times in the water to get rid of any left over dirt or seeds, the big leaves we're removed, the chickweed was wrung and cut into 3- inch-size pieces, and here is the picture!

As for flavor, I'll make a sweet miso-ae, which is miso with a little sugar (in my case, honey) and a dash of vinegar. But I want to try them all raw.

RAW:

The mulberry leaves were exquisite. They had a gentle flavor, a bit like spinach but less intense. I ate them up. The chickweed... Tastes good, but it is fibrous. I need to pick it younger.

MISO-AE

Here is the recipe I used for miso-ae, a sauce to put on freshly steamed veggies.

Mix 2Tbsp miso, 1Tbsp honey or sugar, and 1/2tsp vinegar. This is a protein-packed sauce that people add to cooked veggies in Japan. It makes a nice dip and can be used as a salad dressing, especially if thinned a bit.]]></content:encoded>

<p> I was looking at the droplets of water on the plants I just watered, and thought that it would be entirely logical if our love of gems came from the excitement upon it raining or finding water in prehistoric times, and even up to 200 years ago. Water must have been so treasured, and jewels look so much like little droplets of water... </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>

We found water! Rush back to the cave.<br>Diamonds in sunlight<br>Excitement, life in a moment<br>Rain, rainbow gems<br>Dew, quiet jewels hanging, glittering pink<br>before the last star dissappears<br>A drink, life to berries, life to creatures, life to all</p>

<p>I wonder how long it is going to take lobbying corporations in the resources and agricultural sectors, as well as their political cronies to figure out that working against the environment isn't going to help them. In this episode of 'Ostriches Against the World,' Australian MP is continually attacking climate change proponents by using partial readings of scientific papers. The author, Prof Sandy Harrison, rebutted, saying... "the risk of catastrophic fires will continue to increase.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"She added: “As a scientist, my job is to tell you the facts. Your job is to act on them.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kelly has been prolific in his Facebook attacks on the “climate alarmist cult” and the “prophets of doom” in the past few weeks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the past 24 hours, Kelly has posted six times, attacking climate campaigners at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland as “prophets of doom”, promoting attacks on alarmists, attacking environment activist group Greenpeace, and other posts claiming “fake climate news”." - Quoted from the article.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>People with this stance are in the  losing camp, and  need to look at the global market. Comparatively, green investment is almost the only thing going up, and there's a reason for that. It's time for global leaders and corporations involved in infrastructure to get with the times and start coming up with sustainable solutions FAST.</p>

<p>Here are the herbal combinations that the Chinese government finally turned to during the SARS epidemic. I first heard about them during my research about Houttuynia cordata as an ethnobotanical in Japan. During the SARS epidemic, modern medicine wasn't enough. It seems, looking at the numbers, that SARS was far more virulent than the current 2019 Corinavirus, however, it is good to know some remedies that we might be able to turn to in case modern medicine fails again. This case demonstrates the power of looking back into historical events and finding clues for how to deal with life in the moment.<br>The following table is easier to read inside the text. It is towards the end. The therapeutic functions are listed in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) lingo; just understand that these formulas worked and that is why they were used by thousands of people. Look up the meanings online if you want to learn about them. The methods for making the medicines are in the <a href="http://www.itmonline.org/arts/sars.htm">linked document</a>. Basically, you make a tea and drink it three or more times a day, depending.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is <a href="https://japantoday.com/category/national/pandemic-reveals-hidden-poverty-in-wealthy-japan">so sad</a>... And it's all true. <br>A lot of people have shunned the full-time salary work system for a number of reasons. Heirarchical maniacs, low pay and high hours, and having to stay at work till late. I read a few years ago that the number of part-time workers had grown to record highs. This is the group being referred to that is moving from middle class to poor and poor to extremely poor. There are several bad systemic problems exacerbated by the pandemic. Culturally engrained chauvinism, a lack of privacy within the the family regarding welfare checks resulting in a loss of face, the basic issue of pride, a lack of generosity among people in general because there is no 'kata' for it, and also a systemic breakdown because there is no 'kata.' </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I would like to discuss with a cultural comparison the lack of generosity. In the us, winter in the holiday season, everywhere you go you will see 55 gallon bins and huge boxes at store exits. There, it is encouraged to put a few purchases that you made specifically for that box. Those purchases will go directly to people who are poor. The salvation army guy with the bell stands at almost every shopping center ringing his bell and waiting for people to make donations. I remember sharing the spirit of Christmas and showing pictures, including that of a mountain of toys in Seattle that were being prepared for distribution to the poor and the Japanese students were so surprised because they had never heard about anything like this. Admittedly the activities during Christmas have their roots in Christianity. That being said, I don't hear about it happening in Europe. But in Europe they have other ways of supporting the poor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Anyway, there's nothing like that here in Japan. There was a Catholic church where we got food because we had none when I first arrived back here after getting married years ago. But there's no systemic support system for people who are in poverty and need immediate assistance like food stamps.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To exacerbate the problem the government and businesses consider waste an issue of literally garbage, not something that might have potential, but something that needs to be gotten rid of so that they can sell more products and raise the economy.  There's no concept of circulation of waste products after they become waste. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Businesses are selfishly militant about it. All of the waste bins are locked and food waste from places like 7-Eleven is not available to the poor. In the US if you go to the back of 7-Eleven or to the back of supermarkets and food factories, you can go dumpster diving and get food if you need it. But here that isn't possible because it's all locked down literally with padlocks. How precious is their waste??</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Not only that, in the UK and in the US, for a few years now there have been organizations that take a lot of that wasted food that is canned and dried or surplus, and share it with people who are in need or people who want it. This is to prevent food waste. However in Japan, that doesn't exist. I think that's super selfish and a big problem. Markets should make food available to people who need it, and there should be an organization or 10 dedicated to distributing this surplus of wasted goods. About 10 years ago I remember talking to people about this issue, and being responded to with the attitude of "Why would we do that? No one does it here." Well yes, no one does that here, but we can start!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition, for a company that for a country that prides itself in its recycling program, there's a huge problem with reuse versus recycling. There is no adequate concept of reuse. First of all these so-called recycle shops and thrift shops don't give you more than a few cents for items that are worth a lot more and there's no concept of consignment. That reduces the desire in people to take things to the thrift shops. It also explains the recent boom in apps like Jmty, Mercari, and Yahoo auction. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But because it's simple, most people take their things (that are actually useful and someone else would really appreciate) to the corner for the garbage man instead. The city takes it and changes it into something else or destroys it. This requires energy and is really wasteful.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The process goes like this. When you put your garbage on the corner, there's no way for other people to take it. It's considered thievery. The city comes and takes it and does what they want with it, destroys it, but that isn't really recycling, especially locally. It doesn't help the local people. I think that the system needs to change in that way as well. If there is a large number of people going into poverty, and a population living off of less than ¥160,000 a month ($1,600), there needs to be a concept of social support that goes beyond money and is centered around local needs.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Almost.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My mother is adorable, and she loves to cook. This morning I got something to the effect of this text, "I can't find the recipe for Ramen Ichiban, only stores that sell it!" She sounded pretty sad, so I have decided to help clarify the mystery around a growing global flavor, Ramen.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ichiban means "Number One," so Ramen Ichiban means "Number One Ramen" or "The Best Ramen Anywhere." Needless to say, there are a ton of those shops. 😂 That being said... Ramen is complicated! It's always changing, and different areas have different types, based on the noodles and the soup base. As a disclaimer, since I lived in Kyushu in southern Japan for 10 years, and have lived here in the Tokyo area (Kanto) for over five, I can describe what people have told me and what I've eaten. However, since I have never been north of Ibaraki Prefecture and haven't spent much time around the Osaka/Kyoto area, I don't know much about whether there are pockets of different ramen there that I am missing. And I know that there is some seafood ramen in Hokkaido that I am definitely missing, because I've heard of it but never eaten it (I'm probably missing out)! And I'm fallible, so if there is something that you don't think is quite right, please let us know in the comments below!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So here it is, folks, today's ramen lesson, at the birth of 2021 in Japan.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ramen is incredibly popular in Japan. I was an English teacher in Kyushu, and during that time I taught at almost 50 schools. Invariably, every class introduction at each one involved the question, "What is your favorite food?" -- Or conversely, what is your most disliked food, and I'm going to tell you now, the majority was not natto. -- </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The most favorite foods in Japan for children are Curry And Rice, Sushi, and Ramen. Runners-up were katsu don, Korean BBQ, and Tempura. The levels varied based on the class and location. Judging from the shopping isles at the supermarket and the most popular eateries, I would say that for adults it's also very similar, but I would add Nabe (hot pot, or a kind of soup eaten in a group), Okonomiyaki, Italian food and fried chicken to that list. Probably more, but that's what popped into my head. Statistically speaking, I haven't interviewed people at the grocery store, and there's no way I could get the thousands of responses that I got from the kids either way...</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are three main kinds of ramen in Japan, with some very tasty other variants.<br>Miso Ramen [originally from the Tokyo area (Kanto)]<br>Shoyu Ramen (from the northern area)<br>Tonkotsu Ramen (from Kyushu)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Miso ramen is made with a miso base. The soup, however, is not completely miso, and has some brothy elements to </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ramen originally came from China, and there are some popular variants that are considered to be Chinese, not Japanese:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tantan-men, a spicy and very Chinese ramen and<br>Chuka Soba, not Chinese at all but literally with the name "Chinese Noodles." The Chinese people I know tend to think it is bland. But one of my favorite ramen shops has delicious chuka soba that you can get with a 'seasonal Don bowl;' items of the season including carefully cut sashimi and lightly seasoned vegetables on top of a perfect amount of rice. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In fact, at most ramen shops, you can get "Ramen Sets" with fried rice or some sort of side. A few months ago, I went to a shop and had just their side dish because it looked so good; marinated beef tendon... And it was really quite divine. I rated them with 5-stars for that and their great service on my Google Maps.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are also some new types of ramen, many of which are known for their thicker noodles. My personal favorite is called<br>Tsukemen. You dip the noodles in a thick, flavorful soup on the side.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I like it as long as the soup has a meat base, not a fish base, I really don't like the fish base. One of my favorite shops, (that won prizes for their former recipe) changed their recipe a couple of years ago, and I don't go anymore because of their new recipe combined with their prideful attitude at being so popular.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There's another ramen that is really popular in Kanto Area that doesn't really have a name, rather it is referred to by the thick noodles, 'Futomen.' I like those better than the other ramen noodles, so usually, even though my favorite soup is Tonkotsu, I like the Futomen shops like Jiro Ramen, Dai, and Kaminari.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A little aside on places outside Japan, there is a place with delicious Ramen I had last time I was in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. I went there with my family and it was fun and the food was great, so to have good ramen, you don't have to come to Japan anymore! Ah, globalization. 💕</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Well, I hope you're well and hungry now, haha! </p>

<p>Re-reading the classic Small Is Beautiful by the economist E.F. Schumacher, I found a little gem.</p>

<p>What an amazing, surprising world we live in. If only we always held such fresh viewpoints, like those in <a href="https://www.bangkokpost.com/world/1887745/dogs-being-trained-to-sniff-out-covid-19">this article</a>, we would not be in the environmental and strained political situations we tend to be in.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For us to find endless sustainability, I believe it behooves us to adopt a system that is changeable depending on necessity. Linear only in bite-size chunks. True Test-Driven Development. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We, as the leaders of our world, are doing a horrible job. It is time to reflect our realities in Wabi-sabi rather than the Western ideal of taking all at once. And CoVID-19 is giving us that opportunity.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Opportunity to breathe, take chances in ways we would never have, and begin afresh. Let's do this and keep a curious puppy viewpoint!</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I found this postcard lying on the floor today... it became today's esoteric reading. In this painting by the surrealist Spanish painter Remedios Varo, she captured part of the essence of what I believe is appropriate to the moment. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I think this painting was a twist on the tarot card "The Tower." In the original image, people jump from a burning tower in terror as their world crumbles around them. It is one of the more dreaded cards in the deck, with a meaning of the death of something or extreme changes. A falling apart of what is known.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This painting is done with he same perspective, but with the tower having crumbled, its pieces strewn upon the earth. A flutist is, with music, magically encouraging their piecing back into place in the tower, pulling the world back together.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Coronavirus pulled many people out of their towers, where they thought they were safe and had their lives. They suddenly tumbled down, their known existence in shambles, the tower of their lives ruined. But I see many creative people pulling themselves up with a musical force from the heart, communicating about the true necessities of the world and our own lives. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Tower card of the tarot also symbolizes new beginnings. With the end of something comes the beginning of something new. Thus, in my readings I always bring this point up. The Tower card need not be feared, more it is a call to courage and determination in the face of great change.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This painting by Varo also says that what is needed is creativity and listening to the heart. We can all heal but we need to get creative and listen to what is needed calling from the dark recesses of our silent souls and the silent voice of this beautiful Earth that we live upon. True healing will come when we can face what we truly need to heal: ourselves and our home.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the silence around me, I have been cleaning things up, cleaning out, and trying to reconnect with my inner self. Today I found these paper treasures that I have not been able to let go of. As for the book, I think it is a good idea to read in the morning for a few minutes before doing anything on my smartphone or PC. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dr. Hedberg's account of meeting the Wixarika (Huichol Indians) for the first time in San Blas, stumbling in on a sacred ritual, and then his very strong statement about how we have ethnocentrified their perceptions of what we consider "Gods" is intense. He says that the indigenous people did not say "The Corn Goddess" but rather "Mother Corn," nor the "Sky God" but "Father Sky," and so on, because they did not use the word "God" they used terms for relatives. He states, in italics for emphasis, "to signify nature relatives with that word ("God") is the biggest etymological mistake of the last millennium." I would say this is because the cultural perception of relatives creates a kind of relationship that is much more intimate and a sense of responsibility towards them and an understanding if they are deeply connected with us. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He says, "through their activities and storytelling... They were not talking about or two gods but their relatives in the surrounding nature. they're communicating efforts were aiming at keeping the balance in the mutual dependence between man and their nature relatives the help of him they needed so badly for their existence."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He also mentions the demise of man at the point when he moved from being a hunter-gatherer to being an agricultural and then industrial society. It's not the first time I've heard this, there's a piece by Jared Diamond, who wrote the best-seller "Guns, Germs and Steel," about the deviation and demise of man through what Western education has almost always considered evolution, in his piece in Discover Magazine entitled "The Worst Mistake in the History of the Human Race." When I read it, it rattled me to my senses and solidified awareness regarding the topic.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The editorial piece, from the magazine Clean Slate, published by the Center for Alternative Technology (CAT) in the UK, was written by my dear friend Paul Allen. Though it was written a few years ago, I find it appropriate to meditate upon at this point in time, when we sit quietly in our homes, fearfully attempting to thwart an unseen killer. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He says, "... The challenges are significant, but so are the opportunities... Simply trying to stimulate consumer-spending... won't really solve our long-term economic challenges. However, transforming our consumer-driven economy into something more appropriate to the realities of the 21st century is also no small undertaking -- but this is where the sheer scale of the energy transition becomes its biggest advantage any investment in either generating or saving energy offers a tangible economic return whilst also creating secure long-term employment for a great many people." As I have seen from the market in the US just within the past year, there is a shift increasingly occurring towards Green Investment... However, what is Green Investment? There are various companies attempting to go green, but then there are many more with tongue-in-cheek greenwashing that really do nothing green at all and are just riding the wave like it is a fad. Perhaps some issues stem from the terminologies used in business, which brings us back to linguistics and culture.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In any culture, linguistic psychology creates reality. As an ethnobotanist, I must respect the indigenous naming of a plant in order to more deeply understand their perceptions of it, so in publications I list the original names and meanings. Linguists state that you cannot learn a language without knowing the culture. And John Hedberg recognized the need to return the true meaning of relatives in nature from the bastardization to "gods." </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Thus, there is a need for translation, one might say, to business language, for the meaning of ecological balance and the preciousness of those things that are not worth money to be understood. Economists have been trying to create new systems for years now that will create a balance, but without the cultural understanding built within business language, there may be little space for a long-term resolution. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My hope is that business will begin to evolve due to the pressure to green, just as languages and cultures evolve.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I have had the pleasure of consulting mentors and businesses regarding social-ecological systems and how to integrate businesses into ecology to make them more green, but I felt as though, although well-received, the understanding was not complete. It is definitely a work in progress on both sides. I only wish it were going more quickly, for the Earth we live upon and its finite resources of life, land and sky.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So I was reading this article about how Chinese LCD panel companies are winning the race against LG and Samsung. The article is posted here.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Business-trends/LG-and-Samsung-in-full-retreat-before-Chinese-flat-panel-onslaught</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It seems like there's a tech vortex movement going on; they're just trying to focus on the same technology instead of looking outside the box. They're trying to make old technology better and better, and branch out into new kinds of panels. That being said, they're still panels.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We could be being had; I often feel like they come up with technology and don't actually put it out because they want to make money for the next year or two on old tech, but with this, I don't think that's the case.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I feel like with AR and that kind of technology, there's a lot of potential that hasn't been tapped that relates really closely. I predict that there's going to be a huge shift within the next five years away from solid panels. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I think they probably have people working in think tanks in some of these companies trying to figure out new technology and how to integrate it into AR technology, or maybe I'm wrong. Maybe it's just Google. The thing is that LCD panels (TV's, monitors) take up a lot of natural resources, not to mention space in your house, and I'm sure that there is a better way to convey information. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I know there are a lot of people now using projectors, like the really cool projectors from Xiaomi that can be really close to the wall and are silent and can give you a really nice, big picture, but still projectors have their limitations like light interference. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So I'm thinking, something like some special glasses where you can look into them and see the AR of your favorite TV show or surf the net without having to take up any space at all... Kind of reminds me of a guy from the 1920s with a monocle.</p>

		<title><![CDATA[Yuzu Seedlings]]></title>
		<link>https://www.sofiapenabaz.com/2020/04/22/yuzu-seedlings/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Today I tried to find places to plant my yuzu seedlings around my neighborhood. There was so much concrete, or weed-killed areas, that it was really difficult to find any places where they might survive. When they grow, some people might enjoy them, while others will tear them out of the ground, and that is their right. To me, it is a little gift that I can give back to the world. I hope that many years from now, if someone wants a yuzu fruit and can't find one at the store, they can take a walk and pick one from a wild tree.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These past few weeks I have been enjoying picking some of my vegetables from forgotten corners in my neighborhood, and from my willing neighbor's trees. Wolfberry shoots are bitter but taste so nutritious, and mulberry shoots are delicious and tender. I was told to pick some bamboo shoots… But they are two feet tall now!If we can make more space on our roadsides and unused spaces for wild edible plants, we can raise our resilience levels for times when food might be scarce. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It scares me to think that this could have been MERS instead of CoVid-19. If that had happened, the food system would have collapsed. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If everyone knew what plants are edible, that would be great, but after two weeks or even a few days they would be gone. We need to create a world with more kindness towards other species, plant and animal. Birds spread mulberry seeds. Mulberries can provide not only berries but a nutritious vegetable for your dinner plate. But mulberries often get wacked away. We don't know the value of the species we are destroying by laying down concrete, either. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I was doing research in a small town down south, the elderly residents said they hadn't seen a valued ethnobotanical plant (Ashitaba) for a long time in their neighborhood. I asked them why they thought that was, and they answered that they thought it was because there is too much concrete everywhere.<br /></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It seems like it is okay to rip trees and plants out of the ground, destroying other species' homes, but it isn't okay for us to defend them. Ask the town office why they overprune the roadside and park trees; it is their right to do that but the tree has no rights. The river by my house, covered and sided up by concrete, also has no rights. It isn't okay to plant trees where people don't want them, either. It isn't okay to try to create a viable world for our grandkids. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I think CoVID-19 is a wake-up call for us to realize that we cannot do 'business-as-usual' anymore. We HAVE TO change, or we will fail, big time. But how to change?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Today I found a plant I had never seen before. It had been cut down and was growing out of its stump with the most beautiful leaves. I'm sure whoever hurt it didn't care, and just wanted to make more room in their unused parking lot. Changing is taking baby steps. Opening our minds to new ways of thinking. Refusing to follow those who tell us that "this is the way we have always done it" or "this is the way business will prosper," because business will not prosper long term and neither will any of us if we don't change, NOW. Small actions count!! Let's begin doing little things, thinking about things differently, and the world will change, one person at a time, one community at a time, one city at a time, one country at a time…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So if I would like to make a little Earth Day Wish, it would be for you, the reader, to do something small this week for the natural world. Whether it be planting some edible tree seeds, making a nest box, labeling some wild plants, stop using weed-killer and weeding (cut them and do mulching, cover them with cardboard and compost and plant species you want instead), de-investing in bad companies, donating to a trusted natural cause, sharing an article, making a bird bath, planting a tree in a parking lot, or destroying some concrete and replacing it with something else, or another warm-hearted action. I hope you can do it for yourself, your children, and the world around you.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yes. Let's fast forward about 10 years. Because there are less people in cities, there is less chance for people to spread disease. Also, with more people in localized areas, local business flourishes again. Small businesses, mom and pop shops, and true pride through craftsmanship are given a new beginning. We also find space (in my wholesome and imagined future) for public edible landscape where everyone can meet their neighbors and chat while picking the red raspberries. Because people can get out more freely, there are more local social networks, and there's also a deeper relationship with the landscape, as well as the inhabitants of it, the birds, the butterflies, and the bees. We move forward into another, more mature stage of humanity.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Perhaps there is truth in the magic of dates. On September 11, 1999 an unimaginable tragedy occurred in New York, as America woke up to the crumbling and enflamed Twin Towers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On September 11, 1966 on the other hand, a story of warmth and humanity contradicting what has been taught in American High Schools for so long, was happening in Australia. This story reframes humanity and gives hope. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I was in high school and junior high, almost all of the books we were forced to read were dark accounts of humanity, the evils of society and our world. The Grapes of Wrath, Of Mice and Men, and The Lord of the Flies are titles that everyone recognizes. My fellow students and I all wondered why we were subjected to a deluge of darkness at the dawn of life, and rightly so. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now I see this wonderful story, the true story of the Lord of the Flies, not written by a bitter drunkard, but by the true history of six boys stranded on a deserted island and how they survived for a year and a half all alone by the goodwill of their hearts, comraderie, and their sheer determination. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I have often thought that literary education stands to change. I believe it is ridiculous that our youth should be subjected to suffer through these books, when much more optimistic ones abound. And clearly, as it is proven here, that dark view of society is simply not the only truth, and certainly not the only one we should be giving our next generation. I call for a cleansing of the shelves, a reevaluation of what is important so that we can envision and create a brighter and more human future.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hi guys! I have a suuuuper E-Z, tummy yummy recipe for you today! It is no-bake vegetarian cocoa cookies… Mmm'M!<br>I got a pack of 'Green Banana Flour' on iHerb. There was really no other flour to choose from, but this was pretty cheap and is really healthy, so I'm glad I got it! It doesn't need to be cooked, either. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":226,"sizeSlug":"large"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.sofiapenabaz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/img_20200516_1748331067672569989719535-768x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-226"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It has a similar recipe to what I made on the back, but I like to substitute oils and sugars for things that are less heavy. It calls for 3TBSP of coconut oil… Very greasy. Sometimes we can substitute milks for oils, and in this case it works. I substituted that for 1 TBSP of soymilk. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":225,"sizeSlug":"large"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.sofiapenabaz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/img_20200516_1738496403385406237172107-scaled.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-225"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Instead of rolling the cookies in coconut flakes, I rolled them in Almond Flour, very easy to find in Japan. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And instead of 3 TBSP of hard-to-find Agave Nectar, I added 1 TBSP of Honey plus a tsp of Stevia, so the calorie content is really low but it doesn't have that stevia taste. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here is my recipe. The ingredients don't have to be precise:<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>3 TBSP Green Banana Flour (or coconut flour)<br>3 TBSP Cocoa Powder (unsweetened)<br>3 TBSP Any Nut Butter<br>1 TBSP Soymilk or Milk<br>1 TBSP Honey or a thick Syrup<br>1 tsp Stevia<br>Some Almond Flour spread out in a plate<br>A few Almonds</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mix together everything except the almond flour and the almonds until they stick together, about three minutes.<br>Wash your hands. Take about a TBSP and roll it in your hands. Squeeze an almond into the top and fit it around it. Roll the cookie in the almond flour. Remove the excess. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Put it on a plate and do the next one. Put them in the fridge for a few hours until they have set. Enjoy!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These are amazing cookies!! They are really filling and sweet but creamy, and they don't have that much fat in them. They have a lot of fiber and protein. And best of all, they taste incredible!!</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I read <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/2020/05/bumblebees-bite-plants-flower-early/">this article</a> about an amazing discovery that bumblebees chomp leaves so that the plants will flower... up to a month earlier! They depend on the pollen for nectar. One thing that was obvious to me, but apparently not to the scientists in charge, stood out...</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"When the study authors used metal forceps and a razor to mimic the holes the bees made, the plants bloomed earlier than normal, but not as soon as they did in response to the bees’ bites…'They do something we haven’t quite captured… We hope to figure this out.'…Doing so could create a whole new way for HUMANS to cultivate plants, a potentially major boon for agriculture."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Why don't they just use bumblebees to make the cuts? After all, they are going extinct…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My cousin owns a very successful company in California, dispersing beneficial insects over crops. Give owners have since time immemorial put hives into fruit tree fields to pollinate the flowers to make fruit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We need to start working with nature again instead of trying to do things on our own. I know there are some powerful companies that would like to own seeds and the very DNA of life, but this practice needs to stop. So far it has caused a lot trouble for the world. It's time for us to evolve… By going back to our roots.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was taught as a bio major that certain grazers feeding on plants stimulate them to grow more. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I never suspected that it could extend into the insect family!!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.sofiapenabaz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_20200604_152323-600x800.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-561"/><figcaption>ススメガの幼虫がクチナシを食べる。　Sphyngidae "Hawk Moth" feeding on gardenia</figcaption></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For several years, I have been growing two gardenias. They are native to Japan, but due to my lack of fertilization, perhaps, they have been scraggly since sprouting about four years ago. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This year I found a cute little caterpillar near my plants. And another one. I tried to see which ones they would eat by putting them on different plants, because, you see, caterpillars turn into beautiful flying creatures that pollinate our flowers and fruits. So I didn't want them to die. I found that they liked my gardenias, and knowing it was early spring and they would grow their few leaves back, I put the little guys to graze on them. They chose only the tenderest sprouting greens, and we're quite picky... They turned out to be SuzumeGa (Hawk Moth, or Sphyngidae, Larvae), who eat pretty much only gardenias. They are lovely, huge moths with a shape like an arrow that hover while sipping nectar from flower to flower. I hope they survived because I haven't seen many gardenias around here. </p>

I didn't take this amazing photo (I got it from the free pile) but I wish I had!</figcaption></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gardenias, by the way, come in two types. The horticultural variety, with many petals, and the native to Japan, with only five. That being said, the one with only five petals, also called Kuchinashi (meaning "No Mouth") produces an orange, almost flavorless fruit. This fruit is used as a natural coloring agent, and rather than using carcinogenic Yellow Five, the Japanese use Kuchinashi to color everything edible from candy to everyday packaged foods. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Where did the petals go? Rather, where did the seeds go... The seeds were turned into petals over time, as in many flowers, by gardeners who wanted more elaborate flowers. And the seeds disappeared, meaning that all of those plants have to be propagated vegetatively by cuttings, and cannot have their own babies. They can flower but not fruit. So of we plant them rather than the ones that can seed, they can never make their own... Well, that's another story for another time.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Anyway, lo and behold two months later, the places that were chomped on my Kuchinashis by those colorful babies are now full of leaves!! The moths, I believe, stimulated the leaves to produce more in response. Maybe it is similar to the technique that is being studied for stimulating crop production (see one of my earlier posts); bumblebees bite leaves to stimulate flowering earlier than normal. Anyway, food for thought. Don't let your friends kill the caterpillars! Especially the cool-looking ones!!</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Happy birthday to me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The last of the Amazon Rainforest is being torn down and scorched to ashes. I can feel it. It is a horrible. It is a classic example of the Tragedy of the Commons. The Rainforest has no physical owners... That anyone with power RESPECTS anyway. They are too wise for their own good in this small-minded modern world, and instead call themselves "Guardians of the Forest". Also, they have no money, and in this story, people with money are greedy assholes who want more. So with guns, bulldozers, and flamethrowers, they take it. It's not hard. Because to be a guardian is to understand that nothing in the world is yours. Not your children or your spouse. Nor your pet or your house. Philosophically speaking, we own nothing. We are born with nothing, and we die with nothing. Ownership is an illusion formed by society so that we can create rules and systems... But the rainforest does not work inside our little boxes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The sad thing is that, we are so obsessed with what we have and what we want, that we have forgotten that what is shared is our greatest treasure. Our greatest moments of humanity are spent when we are together in some way, sharing an experience. A concert, an exhibit, an awestriking view, a traditional family dinner, an anniversary, a trip to the park. It is when we give to each other. When we forget "this person is MINE" and instead stare in wonder at the person we love after they have done something that strikes us at the depths of our souls... The sad thing is, the Rainforest and its Indigenous inhabitants are a gift to us all. Like the artists at an exhibit, or the band at the concert, or our loved-one who is not ours but is there for us out of simply being there. We could have sat at dinner with the Rainforest and enjoyed her wonders, and instead we rape her and steal and burn. So that we can have a steak dinner with our loved ones who we know so much better. We don't need the steak dinner... because just like too much sugar, the loss of the forest is going to kill us. Because we are so small, in our little societal boxes, we fail to see that this is going to be our undoing. Our individual greed translates to a colossal demon that is ripping the forests out, vomiting on the oceans, and creating agricultural deserts of nothing but "green", because it is something inedible that does not contribute to the global ecosystem -- meaning no one else can use it except for us. At the same time we increasingly commit atrocities within the social system, underneath our own noses and behind closed doors in the name of "science" for the next LD50 or to test the physical testicular load on rats so that we can see the best supplement for testosterone production. Ridiculous!!! What a joke. The Tragedy of the Commons is no less ridiculous than it was when first coined, and no less deadly. Because whatever is not owned by someone more powerful than anyone else, is going to be abused and destroyed in the name of.... Whatever anyone feels like saying!! "We are going to test on all sorts of little animals, because, well, they aren't human." So WHAT?! "We need more cows, so uh, we're just going to build this farm right here where thousands of species are living now but will disappear." What if it were OUR SPECIES?! </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What.If.It.Were.Our.Family?<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Indigenous people's religions in the USA and Mexico were misconstrued 450 years ago. They did not believe in this Father Sun God or that Mother Rain God. They believe that actually, the rain is their family member, the plants are their family members also. Because they are. Even in the Bible it says that man is to be steward; that means a guardian, not an abusive owner.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And if humanity is able to survive the next hundred and fifty years, it will be because we were somehow able to move past our little boxes, into a wider philosophy that protects the Commons, we found some sort of protection for the Commons, or we lost everything we had and somehow from the garbage left over from our ancestors, we built a new philosophy. One about being sisters and brothers with everything around us, because in the end, that is the only way we can maintain the world "for seven generations" after our own. And the land we stole, we took from the wise who had lived here 20,000 years already, and would live indefinitely, in their family of man and sky and land, enjoying concerts, exhibits, traditional family dinners, and trips to the park, had we not come.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Indigenous Lives are at stake... by our own hands. Please be conscious of your purchases, buy reused goods, eat more vegetables and fruit, and breathe in the moment. "This is OUR Earth, most friendly Earth and fair, daily her sea and shore, through sun and shadow, faithful she turns robed in her azure air..." </p>

<p><a href="https://medium.com/@sunilsingh_42118/you-really-want-to-rehumanize-math-education-build-a-new-ship-8aa6fe6b43d0">https://medium.com/@sunilsingh_42118/you-really-want-to-rehumanize-math-education-build-a-new-ship-8aa6fe6b43d0</a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Had this hopeful future been the case when I was in school, I might have become a physicist. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But because my ability in math was based on time, not actual ability, I was even derided by the teacher in my precalculus class. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That being said, the Fractal of Life, in all its complexity and confusion has led me here, and actually anywhere is really okay. It is the journey, and feeling it, that matters. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At some point maybe the world education system will realize that there is a reason Finland's education system (wherein children are not given homework and are allowed freedom after only three hours of school) has been top-rated worldwide. Maybe they will see that rather than trying to control and test what has been literally crammed into delicate grey matter, it is ultimately better to allow our infinitely more-intelligent-than-us yet extremely naive children to explore their world. After all it is theirs, and they will all tell you their concerns for the future, which are very real... Actually, there may be a correlation with the education system and the fact that Finland is also famous for its social support and peace in its society. It is consistently rated one of the top happiest countries on Earth according to the Happiness Index.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But it may take destroying all we have for reasons included in the Seven Deadly Sins (there is a reason they are called that), before we change our idiotic ways from control and fear of the unknown, to trusting and allowing guided growth. In that healthy future, people might choose very different careers. They might choose happiness instead of money, an in doing so really be alright financially. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In fact, people would be much happier because they would have been training since a young age to follow their interests instead of what they are force-fed to think is what they have to do. In this, the overall quality of everything, from furniture to management would improve, because only those who thought that they were good at something would pursue it, and they would know it from their elementary education. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was once told by Dr. Fujii, the Japanese traditional garden specialist, that the reason Japanese garden trees have changed so much is this. In ancient Japan, the trees were pruned <strong>for the way they wanted to grow</strong>. This style of pruning can still be seen in Kyoto, and the most beautiful example I have ever seen is the tiny private garden in the imperial palace there. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now they are pruned to force them into what is considered the proper form, or what is most convenient for the space. They are caricatures of what they could be, and the gardens suffer for it visually. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The trees, like the children, are being stunted, forced to fit into a mold, and not allowed to become the greatest they could be.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>America - increasingly impoverished, with little social support for the people.  Why would I write this? Because I care. Why do I think this?...</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Well, most Americans -- and I was one of them before -- don't see it. It is hard to see how things are ruined when you live somewhere for years. But when you come back like me and can make comparisons, it is shocking. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is unbelievable to me that due to lack of funding there were only three people working at the 12-window tax office when I went (and only for a couple of hours in the morning), with a long line of people waiting outside. The long lines at the DMV and lack of offices. The lack of funding for libraries and teacher's salaries at schools, while administrators make much more. The lack of convenient public transportation. No publicly supported Health Care System for everyone -- at least where you don't have to pay a billion dollars for an ouchy (Here ambulances are FREE! Yes! Why? Because they are used in emergencies!).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> With the level of social support it has, America reminds me of Mexico, but with good roads, rich people, and less direct corruption.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now, I'm not saying Japan is perfect, by any means. It has its own very long list of social problems, and the result of that can be seen if you click on the World Happiness Report link later in this post. Japan ranks a very low #58 on the report, and for good reason. I also recognize that each place has its good points and its bad points, and that often these are a balance. For example, we could take Japan and say the people are so polite here, yes, they are but it is because they need to be, or else they get ostracized. It is very difficult to work in here. I could write an even longer post on Japan, but that wouldn't be very Japanesey of me ;)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Without limitations in the US, corporate heads get huge salaries, Congress gets paid for life, insurance companies and pharmaceutical companies make unbelievable amounts of money off of an increasingly taxed people, and the list goes on. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is amazing to me how many Americans still haven't figured out they are being led around by a carrot by the false two-party system, and instead support conspiracy theories in their fear. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is time that Agenda 21 was taken out of the closet.<br>American politicians get your acts together, and voters, look around at the other successful countries in the world, or there will be problems due to simple hygiene issues. Let me explain.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> Just like someone who doesn't take a shower or brush their teeth, buy new underwear when needed, and eat properly, America is not doing the basics to maintain what is necessary for a healthy economy. Instead, like an internet gamer waking up, eating junk food and spending hours watching TV and playing video games rather than working towards getting a job, the efforts are badly placed and will ultimately result in a negative balance for the country.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Living in Japan, I have seen some things that make me really reconsider moving back. Here, there is funding support for government entities. Not that they are wallowing in it; the buildings are old but clean. That being said, there are always people to help you at the Japanese DMV, the city hall, and all other branches I have visited. Almost never a long line, and if so people really complain indignantly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There is funding for teachers, not only administrators, and for libraries to buy books. There is a cap on salaries, so most who would make $700k+ in the States don't make more than $150k to $200k, and all jobs are respected because it is a job and someone is working hard every day at whatever they do. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The government has a working health insurance system, and the payment is based on how much money one makes, so no one is left without health insurance and can afford their medicine. If you can't pay now, you can pay later, but the cost is within reason. The list goes on. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In Europe, <a href="https://tarotworldtour.wordpress.com/">my friend just posted</a> that he saw 11 different political parties in Denmark discussing how to deal with their problems, not just two parties pretending to deal with problems while making an easy road for their friends in the back room or waiting for their incumbency term after 8 years. Denmark, by the way, is 2nd in the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Happiness_Report#:~:text=According%20to%20the%202019%20Happiness,the%20happiness%20of%20their%20immigrants.">World Happiness Report</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the US, people of course want to live in beautiful places where there are good schools and infrastructure. But sadly, I don't see it on a whole, and it is not the government's fault (they are just doing what they do best...); it is the people themselves who do not see how their decisions are creating problems.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maybe you think I am simple-minded, but remember, the constitution and the bill of rights can be read in less than an hour. I have done it. Resolving many issues doesn't have to be complicated and long. It has to be clear, have breadth and depth and logic. It has to have the qualities of <a href="https://theelementsofthought.org/the-intellectual-standards/">the intellectual standards of critical thinking.</a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here are my recommendations. They are not many, and definitely don't cover most topics, but they are a start. If you have other things you would like to see change, write them in the comments section!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I think we need to encourage bike lanes. It isn't bad to have bicycles, and it is dangerous for people riding them. Encourage public transportation. Encourage putting money into the DMV and schools, so that you don't waste time in line, and your children grow up healthy in body and mind.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's time for America to grow into America The Beautiful from America on crutches.<br>Please read this <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agenda_21">Wikipedia article on Agenda 21</a> and find out where America stands, and why you should care.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is a fascinating story on the complicated relationship of the stakeholders in Florida's wilderness, explaining pretty well the issues faced on all sides. It isn't a new story, either, as it is a problem in many developing areas. However, as I see it, developers are antiquated in their planning methods. As a planner, I think that the story could change if there were a combination of subsidies for farmers so that they have some support and don't have to sell their land, and of environmentally conscious developers considering the wildlife corridors and absorptive qualities of the land they buy that triggers water issues when developed. After all, as the population grows (and Americans aren't into micro cities), people need more places to live. So to design places in such a way as to:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol><li>Do no grading or limited grading to retain native plants, microbes, seeds, and mycology.</li><li>Create wildlife corridors within suburban complexes to allow for other creatures to exist</li><li>Plant only native species in landscaping and avoid classic-style lawns</li><li>Create and retain more places for wildlife within subdivisions, and not cut down big trees</li><li>Design houses higher above the ground and with less of a footprint, making them higher quality than quantity. For example, getting creative, like using recycled or locally-sourced materials or with designs, like pools and gardens on the rooftops.</li><li>Subdivisions with a central area having a small kiosk or shops, community center, and park -- basically centrally located places to interact with one's neighbors in order to improve community, as seen in classic cities such as Barcelona and small towns in Mexico.</li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>… And I'm sure there are a lot more ideas we could all come up with if we tried.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What I do know is that for a long time, everywhere in the world, developers have been in it for the money, and it's time that changed. They should be put to the bar as responsible for the futures of communities and areas (in this case wildlife areas), and as Spider-Man said, "with great power comes great responsibility."</p>

<p>Here is a report by Amazon Watch of beneficiaries to the burning of the Amazon Jungle. Yes, folks, it's happening again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As a CNN article stated yesterday, Bolsonaro called it lies, but "evidence shows differently." There is illegal logging and slavery happening. China is the biggest buyer of products from the Amazon... but who buys the end products? The report gives advice for governments on how to deal with the issue, and long lists of companies that are investing in the carnage. Some of ways we can combat it:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>1. To write to the companies with which we are investing and express our dismay at their irresponsibility... and if at all possible boycott them if they don't respond.<br>2. To reuse and recycle, not buy new furniture.<br>3. To invest with green investors and companies that are trying to go green.<br>4. To donate to NGOs like this one, so that we can get more quality information and someone is out there working to stop what is happening.<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Amazon Rainforest provides us with many things that we need --- Alive. Not in our kitchens or living rooms.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is a positive story from Southern California. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/environment/2020/aug/20/joshua-tree-endangered-species-california-opposition</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Even as developers and politicians in California attempt to thwart efforts to save Joshua Trees, a few people have begun to show that even though they are protected by needing a permit to cut them down, all 200+ permits passed last year. One person started a bill to protect the tree further, after 42,000 acres burnt down last year. You can see the details in the article.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What is heartening to me is that even though things may seem dark for the tree, there are people who are moving forward doing what they can in their own little ways. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It reminds me of the Bible story of David and Goliath. No matter how big the bully may seem, there must be a way to defeat it. Let us put our hearts and our heads together to move forward in whatever ways we personally find passion in. The world needs us. We may be small, but we are not weak. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also, strength is not just literal fighting. It is following your joys, what makes you feel happy, while doing something for the world. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of course, we need to be smart about it. My father told me I couldn't study Art in university because I wouldn't be able to make a living off of it as an adult. It was practical advice, and so I chose Biology, and that has been a really good decision I think, throughout my life. I studied two extra years for things that interested me, and was able to study Sumi-E in Japan. I think this helped me in the long run; my grades and my self-esteem were raised by doing things that I was good at while studying difficult subjects... I guess what I want to say is that just because we want to do something, doesn't necessarily mean it is the best thing. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I think we should think carefully about the consequences of not acting right now in certain respects. I hope that my posts make a difference. Getting a Ph.D. was important, but I don't know that anyone will ever read my dissertation. It's a shame, because five years went into it, but the most important thing for me was the wisdom I got out of doing it. As I write posts that are related to my research, I think they reach many more people than my studies ever will, unless I get famous. But during those five years of studies, I did a lot that I felt was good. I saved a lot of little animals, I was a volunteer at Kizuna Baby (an orphaned baby massage organization), I helped fellow students, organized community music events, and other social events for students...</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But right now, for me, writing blog posts is one of the most powerful things I can do right now, I think. I also think that making videos about edibles and medicinals would be fun and well-appreciated.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What can you do for the world, something that you think you are good at and love to do? I'm sure you are full of treasures. 🌟</p>

<p>I learned a new Japanese idiom today. It is 鶴の一声. It means "the decision that has been made by the highest ranking official or person." It sounds so stiff in English. The literal translation is, "the single call of a crane."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So I decided to write a poem, a haiku.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>美白氷河の鏡　鶴の一声　私らの血を呼ぶ。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The whitening glacial mirror</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Crane's solitary voice</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Calls our blood.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>People often don't get my poems... They are too symbolic. I end up having to explain them... Can anyone guess the meaning?</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The famous <a href="https://youtu.be/vpTHi7O66pI">TED Talk by Alan Savoy</a> about changing deserts to grasslands was first on my YouTube watchlist today. This was after I read this wonderful <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/sacredsuenos.wordpress.com/2018/04/27/goats-destroying-the-landscape-or-healing-it/amp/">blog post by Sacred Sueños</a>, a darme un the Andes where the forest was burnt down in 1999 to bring in cattle... And afterwards was used for corn and other crops, until the land was unusable anymore and it came into their hands.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The message is this:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After we have brought grazing animals to the land, whether it be desert land that is unusable, or grasslands, if we want it to become forest again or even crop land, we need another step. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We have to give it chance for succession if we want it to be productive again. We need to allow it to feed and for the soil to grow with mulches and leaves from trees and bushes, for the microbes and organisms to live within it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It really makes sense. There is a wonderful video about a professor from the US going back to his native land in Africa, where the people were struggling to eat from the land, and creating a new biome with water and forest through agroforestry.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The traditional way of agriculture isn't working for us. It will be our undoing, as it has been for so many cultures before ours. This is the power of history: let us learn from it and not make the same mistakes.</p>

		<title><![CDATA[Higan Mindfulness]]></title>
		<link>https://www.sofiapenabaz.com/2020/09/21/higan-mindfulness/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yesterday I woke up really early, before dawn, and went to practice Mindfulness Meditation at the Buddhist temple near my house. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I have been studying Mindfulness Meditation for about two years now.It was originally developed by Jon Kabbat Zinn at the Harvard Medical School for treating people with chronic diseases such as Cancer and chronic pain. Over the 30 years since it's inception, its uses have expanded to include everything from severe mental disorders to stress, and where it seems to work best is in the realm of the mind. Thousands of studies have supported the case for it's use in psychology to benefit society.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are many kinds of meditation, including guided meditation and chanting. I have practiced those, too. Before coming to Japan, I lived in San Francisco and tasted a variety of different kinds. But my first experiences with it I have to credit to my mother, who would sit with me and guide me into it as a child. I remember many times finding the light in my heart and finding peace as well. She says I used to sit for about 45 minutes in silence by myself, and some mysterious things happening, like once I came back and said that "Grandma and Grandpa are on an airplane from Europe!" Which was true, and I had no way of knowing it because we hadn't spoken to them and they hadn't told us. I remember in my teens meditating on the moon, and that was when I started to see beautiful circles of colored light, kind of like what I've heard can be seen on the screen in biofeedback. That happens a lot.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But my recent studies in meditation haven't been spiritual. They are more geared towards regulating my emotions. Life can get stressful, for everyone, and it has been proven to be most effective for that. That being said, it isn't just for making you calm.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The way it works is you sit in a comfortable place, preferably not too comfortable so that you don't go to sleep. You close your eyes, take a few deep breaths, and then just start to watch. You watch how you breathe. You scan your body from the tip top of your head to the soles of your feet. You notice your breath. You feel yourself becoming calmer and calmer, relaxing your body when you feel tense places, allowing your body to adjust into a peaceful state. You watch your breath. Come back to it. You listen carefully to the things around you. Further and further away. Then come back to the breath.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over the course of this, your mind will invariably wander, and that is wherein&nbsp; the key lies. When you notice that your mind has wandered, you gently come back to the breathe. How it enters your body. How your stomach lifts. The tip of your nose where it comes in. And then your mind at some point will wander again. And you gently come back to the breath. You become <strong>mindful</strong> of your mind.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is the key to mindfulness meditation in the school in which I practice. It begins with watching the wandering mind. But with time and practice, one begins to notice their thoughts. You can label them, and then begin to put thoughts, memories, emotions, urges, into 'buckets' and label them. You begin to notice what it is that preoccupies your mind and causes you stress. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then here's the real kicker. Once you get good at that, you start to notice it when you aren't meditating. In the act of doing something out of character or experiencing something uncomfortable. You begin to realize how your reactions to life affect it. And that is something.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With this knowledge, you can move forward in life. I would say that most of us live life without really examining how we live or why we do things. We are creatures of habit. But once you begin to notice how you affect your own life, you begin making different decisions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.sofiapenabaz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/20200920_0608036304579569441207090-600x800.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-619"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, anyway, back to the temple. So I figured it was Sunday, and the old monk had invited me to listen to the ancient drumming and bells anytime I wanted… But he does it at 6:30AM. So I had woken up early on a Sunday, and decided to do the things that people do on Sundays when we want to feel particularly close to God, whatever we may deem them to be. I went to the temple and began to meditate. It was locked, and he was not up yet, so sat on the steps. At one point, he opened the door slightly and I greeted him, but stayed there watching the morning. He played the drums and bells. The little birds came out. The sky changed, exploded in a dawn of color and then mellowed into a gentle morning. The leaves of the trees swayed, and I listened. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The monk is pretty old, in his mid 80's, but so full of life, very energetic, and loves to teach. He told me about the equinox holidays in Japan. The spring and fall equinoxes are days of rest in this country. He says that the days surrounding them are important, too. The three days before and the three days after have an important Zen Buddhist function, and the entirety of the week is referred to as <strong><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higan">Higan</a></strong>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>During the three days before the equinox, one should practice these three things: you should be generous with others, keep your promises, and strive to be patient and open-minded. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After the equinox, you should: gaman (refrain from excesses and persevere), meditate, and study the wisdom of the scriptures (here, he emphasized that it should not be 'human' wisdom, because humans are not pure of thought).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After he told me, I thought that maybe this is why many Japanese people consider patience, quiet listening, and perseverance to be essential elements of their culture.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-49609-9">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-49609-9</a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Takeaway: For children and adults taking Atomoxetine, supplement it with vitamins C &amp; E, and other antioxidant sources like fresh fruit and vegetables. This will most likely prevent DNA changes and preserve healthy mitochondrial activity in the brain cells. If they are not taken, it seems that some serious cellular changes occur over time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A large percentage of people take these kinds of medications, even though we have little knowledge about their effects. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>...Actually, this is my own assessment from reading other articles about psychiatric drugs, but we don't know enough about their effects on the brain/body system. It is clear that they often cause weight gain, over which mitochondrial activity is one factor. Also, I have read that they can cause permanent changes in DNA. So actually, if you or anyone you love is taking these medications, it is probably a good idea to supplement them with antioxidants no matter what drug it may be.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Recently, I joined a sketch group with some lovely ladies here in Japan. One of them asked for some tips on how to improve her sketching.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I see everyone's drawings, they are so creative. Even though most of us are seeing things from the same angle since we are on video chat, we use different techniques, feelings, textures and media, to complete the drawings. For me, everyone's drawings are unique and beautiful. But I think that the most important thing is that they believe that about their own work. Let me explain.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":630,"sizeSlug":"large"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.sofiapenabaz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_20201102_121955_220-1001x800.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-630"/><figcaption>Still of Cabosu &amp; an Apple</figcaption></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A few things helped me learn how to sketch better.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One was when I took an extra year of college to study art and music. One of my teachers trained us to do an activity on the shorter sketches (2-3 minutes) where we could not look at the paper, except to reorient. We had to sketch while looking only at the subject. No only that, we were not to take the pencil off the paper, but to trace the form of the object over and over. Of course, the sketches looked horrible, but the feeling was different... It became much easier to understand what we were looking at.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another was a wonderful book by my favorite philosopher <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Franck" target="_blank">Frederick Franck</a>, called "<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.michelledujardin.com/zen-drawing" target="_blank">The Zen of Seeing</a>." This wonderful book teaches one how to really look at the subject without judgement.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, I had the extremely good fortune to be given a trip by my Austrian grandfather as a graduation present at 22. It was a month-long Eurail Pass. In every city I went I visited at least one if not multiple museums. I learned from the great masters, tracing their wisdom in my sketchbook. There is absolutely nothing like looking at the real thing to understand which line came first. That month was probably the greatest lesson of all in studying the human form in particular.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I also studied watercolor in college, and then took three years of Sumi-E from a master -- <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://instagram.com/shoshikodes?igshid=121wfkqu1g88e" target="_blank">Shoshiko Sensei</a> -- in Kurume. He taught me that in just a few carefully planned strokes, the essence of something can become filled with spirit and detail. Some wonderful artists like <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://instagram.com/shoshikodes?igshid=121wfkqu1g88e" target="_blank">the Harusakis</a> demonstrate specific techniques such as extensive layering and patience to create some amazing effects. Watercolor, and especially Sumi-E, force the artist to surrender to the medium. It is impossible to erase what one has created. This makes it a kind of meditation and is training in allowing things to happen the way they will, because you cannot erase your mistakes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The rest was just practice, practice, practice. And not judging whether something was good or not, just letting it be what it was. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I am definitely not the best at sketching. My lines are not straight and I shake and there are probably a billion things I could do better. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But it's like meditation. Each day is different, and appreciating the art as a gift I have been given in time and space, as an opportunity to live, changes any judgement I might have to gratitude. I'm so thankful to this group, to the organizer for putting it together and to everyone for making it a community. I was doing maybe one sketch every six months. Now it's a few a week.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, in short, I recommend reading that <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.amazon.com/Zen-Seeing-Drawing-Meditation/dp/0394719689/ref=pd_aw_sbs_14_1/138-0009044-6923159?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=0394719689&pd_rd_r=e56f3e15-06ec-47d8-a02f-51509830e722&pd_rd_w=0crcd&pd_rd_wg=19Lzl&pf_rd_p=b3270d36-43b9-4db6-bead-e7bd5014e5a2&pf_rd_r=XSA0WC5X3NDBRY5BSXC8&psc=1&refRID=XSA0WC5X3NDBRY5BSXC8" target="_blank">book</a>. Try tracing without looking at the paper once per session. Going to the museums in the big city (if you have the energy) and sketching would be an enjoyable and educational past time -- especially considering we near Tokyo have the very good fortune of being next to one of the greatest art-loving cities of the world, with perhaps hundreds of museums.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But most of all, I would say to try to consider the art as something that is a gift that you were given, to hold gratitude towards it. That will remove the judgements surrounding it and allow you to develop without faltering at each step.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Just as we tell our students that to improve in English they need to make mistakes, we could look at life and art with the same eyes and say that in order to move forward it is important to take each step as a lesson, appreciate it, and move on. This will be the wind in your sails leading you to lands unknown.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When a loved-one passes away, there are so many emotions that it can be overwhelming. Coupled with work, it can seem like there is no option but to recover quickly and get on with life-as-usual. But doing so holds many negatives...</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some people turn to drugs and alcohol to deal with loss and pain. The problem with that is that, even though it might help in the moment, long-term it has severely debilitating effects on how you can move forward in life. Mood-altering substances produce confusion in the brain. Though used for the supposed purpose of healing, they hinder the ability of the mind to go through the motions of grief and then navigate back to how to deal with reality. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By numbing and denying, one not only loses the way, but also denies the pain and shuts down important aspects of the relationship, such as memories of the person, feelings for them, and urges thought why are gone. This denial buries these feelings in the subconscious where they affect the future of the griever through illness, stress, emotional instability, and other happenings that are opposite to real healing. In a way, the person who is gone can never find peace, and the person who is grieving can never really move on.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rather than pushing through grief with <em>resilience</em> and <em>control</em>, Ossefort-Russel believes and I concur, that "the terms <em><strong>fortitude</strong></em><em>, </em><em><strong>bear-with-courage</strong></em><em>, </em><em><strong>transform</strong></em>, and <em><strong>humility</strong></em> underlie a story that honors the strength" of being honest to your feelings when someone passes away. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I hold the strong belief that without those feelings of acceptance, you deny the person their existence, pushing them away into the nether world so that you can get back to business-as-usual. It lacks integrity. One needs to accept their loss in order to honor them, and it can take a long time to recover when you aren't denying it in your heart through <em>resilience</em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Silence, mindfulness meditation (feeling the pain in your body, thoughts, memories... and letting it go), journaling, sharing your feelings with someone close, therapy; these are all ways that you can honor your grief and also your loved-one. Feel it to the fullest and let it go; this will honor both your feelings and the person who was so very important in your life.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These methods are ways that one can truly move forward with integrity and become a deeper and more truly resilient person in the end, through acceptance and change.</p>

<p>今日は、とても嬉しいです!私の地元紙に誇りを持ってます。SDGsのとても良い記事が載せてます。等々、日本にこういう大切な話しが普段の処で見つけて、日本にこの3年間ぐらいに段々SDGsのお話しが少しずつ普通の人達の日常生活で発見して、希望が上がります。<br>私達はこういう大切なお話が出来る日が来ると問題の解決も近づきます。<br><br>よく、平和を守る為に、問題持っている人間や喧しい状態に直面されると逃げるの選択をする人が多い。しかし、そうすると問題は解決しない。<br><br>こう思います。人で例えしましょう。もし人であれば、も話しし無いと決めたら、その人の中で色んな質問が浮かべるでしょう。まず、なぜ？そして、彼らにとって、どうやってその問題を解決出来るかと、未来の人間関係のやり方さらに分からなくなる。とても寂しくなるかもしれません。だから、勇気を持って、何か気にいらないならちゃんとその人と話して、起こっている理由教えて、そして、もしその人とを別れしたいなら教えるべきだと思います。それなら、彼らの未来の道もはっきりになります。<br><br>他の問題も含めてます。もし何か気にいらないとか心配なら、話さないとコミュニケーションが生まれない。もしかして、他の人も貴方と同じ考えてが有りますがその人を一人で言うのが怖い。だから自分の意見を出すべきと思います。得には環境問題に。だって、木や野鳥に声が無い。水にも。少数派にも。だから、みんな様、勇気を持って、彼らの為の場所を作って、声出しましょ。</p>

<p>My Mama used to tell me stories about her homeland in Cuba. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In one of my favorite stories, she said that when she was a little girl, every day at sunset the people would go out into the street to sing and dance. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":655,"sizeSlug":"large"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.sofiapenabaz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/wp-1610190337478.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-655"/><figcaption>My mother dancing around with a broom. That's my baby brother in the background.</figcaption></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She said the people would go out and dance happily with things like brooms.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She would dance around the house listening to a myriad of music... My childhood was filled with sunny afternoons where the light filtered into the sliding door, lighting up hanging plants, a big fuschia, a huge begonia with brilliant red flowers, and images of my mother dancing, dancing, singing through the house, to salsa, to Mozart, to funk, to The Pointer Sisters. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":656,"sizeSlug":"large"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.sofiapenabaz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/wp-1610190557427-1067x800.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-656"/><figcaption>The Bay of Banderas, Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco, Mexico. We shared this view for 34 years, and how the city changed.</figcaption></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My brother and I then followed suit. We had our own collection; Paul Simon, The Gypsy Kings, and several Billboard Oldies tapes including 1957 and 1964. We pranced around, flying like pixies in the open living room. From the balcony that overlooked the sapphire-like Bay of Banderas, our music wafted over the red-tiled houses, and we gleefully danced our afternoons away until the sun's gifted last rays of gold...</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That house is going away on Monday, sold into someone else's dream. I wish for future days of music. I wish for space to dance around, and warmth, and happier days. I have no doubt that they will come, just as the sun rises each morning. We are blessed, we only need to give thanks and dance, and the universe will dance with us in rays of pink and blue and gold.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I, uh, went to the karaoke box by myself today.

I used to sing a lot until Shinpei got sick a few years ago, and something started to wither within me... but I still sang and refused to completely give up until he actually passed away. Then I was lost. Throughout my entire life, it had been how I healed myself when I was depressed. But I have been having a hard time singing since he passed on.

I found going to karaoke to be very cathartic. At home I had tried and it hadn't worked out. I felt trapped. Every time I would try to sing alone, I would cry... and it has been months like this. But towards the end of my karaoke session, I felt much better. I felt like I was able to hit notes I hadn't hit in a long time, and the strength in my voice and my vibrato came more freely.

In general, recently, despite the situation, I'm feeling really thankful for my life and this chance that I have on Earth to make ripples of joy or peace in people's lives. I pray for the necessary vitality to take me forward and out of this sad shade I have been under since he disappeared, and before that. I am thankful all the time for the moments we were together and for all he taught me. It was really very hard, but I loved him immensely and I don't regret my time with him. It's amazing how old I feel now, and how many eye wrinkles have appeared, after six months of this.

But each day is a little brighter, and I realize that I am still alive bit by bit, even though there is an emptiness where he once was. Part of going into the light is the struggle.

Life is a struggle, but the struggle brings treasure.
I hope to be able to share what I find.
I wanted to upload Moon River, which I sang today... It is a horrible recording, and it's my first time actually really putting some effort into singing in a very long time. I used to practice every day. May this wonderful, light-filled, guiding Universe be my Moon River to share this World and all of its inhabitants with me.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, I read a lot of academic medical papers, especially regarding nutrition. It seems we're always learning more about how the human body works. But, I realized today that I also read a lot of papers about cats. This is because I have two of them and they're elderly with problems. I figured that since I read so much, it might be beneficial to other people to write about what I learned sometimes. So I thought I'd share what I'm learning about now.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Currently one of my cats, Bina, has a problem with possible pancreatitis. Up until a few days ago, she had been losing weight and she looked really bad. Her fur was getting scruffy and she was listless and vomiting almost every meal. She was scratching her neck and had some sort of rash that would get worse with the low-fat diet food I was giving her.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I haven't taken her in for her ultrasound yet, but after a visit the the vet with a blood test her lipase levels were really high. I started searching around on the web for papers referencing what to do in cases of irritable bowel disease, pancreatitis, feline regurgitation, and high levels of lipase. I found quite a bit of stuff. The most shocking was that almost everywhere I looked, it said that many vets say not to give cats in this kind of situation fats, but that although this applies to humans and other animals, it doesn't apply to cats. Their internal organs work differently... Thus, sometimes there are anomalies. And in this case, almost all of the places said that you can give cats fats even if they have high levels of serum lipase. Even though that was the only recommendation by the vet. No fats, and to limit her to kibbles.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now, a lot of other places said that you're lucky if you can get your cat to eat at this point. Also, cats should be on a liquid diet so that they can get their hydration back.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I pulled on her neck skin, and it slowly went back down to normal. Wow, she's pretty dehydrated. So at that point, I pretty much threw everything that I had been told out the window and started doing my own research. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I use triangulation when I'm researching information on the web. That means, that at least three veterinarians or academic sources have to say something similar in order for me to accept it as possible fact. Also, the words can't be plagiarized and each has to be a different academic paper. The information should preferably be newer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What I found was that the most common treatment for the situation is to ultimately treat them with antioxidants and to rehydrate the cat with a potassium rehydration liquid first, because usually they are dehydrated. Sometimes this involves force-feeding because they refuse to eat, and some places they don't even worry about what they're feeding the cat because cats can go into a dangerous bodily shock if they don't eat for too long. In general, my cat doesn't have too bad of problems eating; she's a glutton. But my choice of food for her has mostly been dry kibbles, with wet food at night. Almost every day she throws up. So what I did was change her diet to wet food, with vitamin supplements added.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One hint was the vitamin B complex. I was not shocked to find that vitamin B complex, especially folic acid can be helpful. Also, she is particularly low because I give her Coenzyme Q10 for her heart problems (5 years ago she almost died -- within 2 weeks of coenzyme Q10 treatment she was fine)... But Coenzyme Q10 uses Vitamin B during absorption into the system... Even though I supplement the cats with Yeast flakes, I guess it isn't enough, because the other day I found her attacking a B vitamin pill that I had dropped, and devouring the contents... So B Complex was in.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The supplement that's most recommended for her situation is Sam-e. Other than that, vitamins E, C, K2, A, B vitamins, and other antioxidants are recommended. Other than that, some places recommend probiotics, and in humans with pancreatitis they recommend using digestive enzymes to aid the pancreas in digestion while balance is returning but it hasn't been tested in cats. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I mashed up her wet food and mixed in B complex and vitamin C and added almost as much water as food. She gobbled it up. Within the day, she was already starting to look less anorexic and her nape skin was falling a little faster. Within 3 days she has almost returned to normal. Her eyes are sparkling, her nape skin can be lifted and drops into place almost immediately, and she looks just so much better. She wants to race me and play. I'm so happy she feels better. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I'm waiting for the Sam-e, Vitamin E, and an antioxidant set of resverotol with vitamin A to arrive. I've been giving her small amounts of K2, C, and digestive enzymes with lots of water. She gets her regular Coenzyme Q10 and the new addition of vitamin B Complex, but I have tapered off the dosage as she took a lot for a couple of days. I check the dosages  and vitamin types before feeding them to the cats. Some vitamins are dangerous for cats. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I'm considering the raw or semi-raw food diet, but at this point, high liquid wet food seems like it may work. I know it has more chemicals, but it also has a lot of water and the cat will eat it... That being said, for the long-term I am considering different raw food diets at the moment for both of them.</p>

<p>Poem "Rising Sun" by Sofia Penabaz-Wiley, on January 5th, 2023, upon opening the gate for the albañiles and rising to the 3rd floor to find the splendor of day had begun considering it's ascent into The Times.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The simple version was: </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I love how the rising Sun caresses the expectant Mountains,<br>bathing them and pastels of purple and pink and orange,<br>where there was only gray a moment before.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And I wanted to say something about the little doves, greeting that union in graceful explosions of wings and voice, but I dared not invade that peaceful space between the Mountains and the Sun, it stayed a bit quieter in verse.</p>

<p>I was thinking a new thought.<br>Before, I believed that there were things that could be done by someone else if I don't do them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now I see, years later, that there are many things that only I can do. <br>Not only that, the state of the universe in that moment is special to fit whatever it is I have conceived of. So if I don't do it, quite possibly it could disappear into the fabrics of time and space, never to come to be.<br>I was thinking this about research into bird behavior and language, which I wanted to research as a child, but didn't know I could and neither did anyone else. I wanted to be a bird watcher. Over the years, I have considered it again over and over, but it always seems like something less important than what I could do.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But I see also, now, that if I don't do it, it will probably never be done, at least not the way I would have. Or what I would have studied.<br>My genius Grandpa once told me (after having live half a life of debauchery), "La vida no es un juego ni una diversión." He was nearing his end, and he still wanted to do so much. I feel that way, too, though perhaps not quite as intensely since I'm still pretty young... Life goes by... It's never long enough. We should do what we can while we can, before it's too late.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So if you have a dream that you want to come to life, chase it. Don't let it slip into oblivion. Give it life, breathe your soul into it.</p>
